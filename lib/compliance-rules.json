As of the general GST framework, special category States primarily comprise several North‑Eastern and hill States (e.g., Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and others as notified).

          "Certain activities and supplies that are wholly exempt from GST or are non‑taxable (for example, specified health care, education, and certain agricultural activities) may not trigger registration solely because of such exempt supplies; however, mixed supplies and reverse charge obligations can alter this position and must be evaluated separately.",

These guides state a cap of ₹5,000 on the late fee per return. Open.money illustrates this with an example: a Nil return delayed by 10 days results in a late fee of ₹200 (₹20 × 10 days). In addition, interest at 18% per annum is levied on any tax liability paid after the due date (ClearTax and SSCO India), calculated on the unpaid tax from the day after the due date until the date of payment using the formula: Interest = Tax due × 18% × (Number of days of delay ÷ 365). Wrongful or excess input tax credit (ITC) claims, or excess reduction in output tax liability, draw a higher interest rate of 24% per annum (SSCO India and ClearTax). Further, a Taxtmi discussion notes that some State authorities have imposed a general penalty under Section 125 of the CGST/SGST Acts of up to ₹50,000 (₹25,000 CGST + ₹25,000 SGST) for delays (they specifically mention GSTR-3B but the same section can apply to general GST contraventions), so persistent or serious non‑compliance with GSTR-1 obligations can attract such discretionary penalties in addition to late fees and interest."

Interest at 18% per annum is payable on any additional tax liability declared in GSTR-9 that is paid after the original due date for the relevant GSTR-3B periods. Wrongful ITC admissions uncovered in the annual reconciliation may also trigger 24% per annum interest on excess ITC.

            "extensions": "The 2025 search snippets do not show explicit extended dates for GSTR-9C, but given previous patterns, any extension announced for GSTR-9 is commonly mirrored for GSTR-9C. Final dates must be checked in CBIC notifications applicable to the relevant financial year."

          "penalty": "There is no separate late fee specified in the snippets for GSTR-9C, but failure to furnish a required reconciliation statement can be considered non‑compliance with Section 44 read with Section 35 of the CGST Act, and can attract penalties under Section 125 (general penalty up to ₹25,000 under CGST and a matching amount under SGST) and potentially Section 122 if it leads to tax short‑payment or incorrect reporting. Any additional tax liability emerging from reconciliation and paid late will draw 18% per annum interest, and wrongful ITC identified through the audit may attract 24% per annum interest on the excess ITC until reversal and payment."

      "additionalInfo": {
        "registration": "Multiple 2025 resources (ClearTax's GST registration limits, IndiaFilings, ProAnalyser, LegalWiz, Kladana, GST MSME booklet and the GST Council flyer) collectively confirm that: (a) For suppliers exclusively dealing in goods in regular category States, GST registration is mandatory once the aggregate turnover exceeds ₹40,00,000 (₹40 lakh). (b) For suppliers of goods in special category States, the exemption threshold is about ₹20,00,000 (₹20 lakh). (c) For suppliers of services across India, the base threshold is ₹20,00,000 (₹20 lakh), while service providers in special category States have a lower threshold of ₹10,00,000 (₹10 lakh) per the Kladana 2025 guide. Aggregation is on an all‑India basis across all business verticals having the same PAN. When the applicable threshold is crossed, registration is 'non-negotiable' as explicitly stated in the LegalWiz MSME GST compliance checklist. Voluntary registration is permitted even below the threshold, in which case all return filing and payment obligations fully apply. Certain categories (e.g., certain e‑commerce operators, persons required to deduct/collect TDS/TCS, inter‑State suppliers in defined categories) must register irrespective of turnover, although these details are beyond what is shown in the search snippets and must be checked against the CGST Act and latest notifications.",
        "renewal": "GST registration does not require periodic renewal; it remains valid until it is cancelled by the tax authorities or surrendered by the taxpayer. However, persistent non‑filing of returns (such as GSTR-3B) can result in suspension or cancellation of registration, after which reactivation or fresh registration would be required. While there is no formal renewal cycle for GST registrations, SMEs must maintain continuous compliance (filings and payments) to avoid such actions.",
        "filingMethod": "All core GST returns (GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, GSTR-5, GSTR-6, GSTR-7, GSTR-8, GSTR-9, GSTR-9C, and IFF) are filed electronically via the common GST portal (www.gst.gov.in). The GST portal provides online forms and offline tools/utilities for data preparation and upload. Authentication is typically through Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) for companies/LLPs and through electronic verification code (EVC) options such as OTP for other entities. State portals like the Delhi Trade & Tax website mirror due dates but the actual filing is centralised on the GST portal. Payment of tax, interest, late fees and penalties is also effected online via the GST portal using internet banking, NEFT/RTGS, or OTC methods as permitted.",
        "prerequisites": "Key prerequisites for GST compliance include: (a) Valid GST registration (GSTIN) linked to PAN, supported by KYC documentation and bank details. (b) Proper classification of goods and services with correct HSN/SAC codes to avoid penalties for incorrect invoice or HSN usage (TCS iON penalty guide mentions penalties for wrong HSN code). (c) A robust invoicing system aligned with GST invoicing rules (ProAnalyser’s 2025 compliance guide stresses compliant invoicing as a core requirement). (d) Maintenance of accurate books and records for outward supplies, inward supplies, ITC, and payments to support monthly/quarterly return data and the annual GSTR-9 and 9C reconciliation. (e) For QRMP taxpayers, internal processes to decide whether to use the fixed sum or self-assessment payment method and whether to use the IFF for the first two months of each quarter. (f) Reliable tracking of due dates and extensions, using updated calendars such as ClearTax’s GST calendar, DMI Finance's due date calendar, GimBooks’ monthly due date posts, and Delhi’s official due date page.",
        "recentUpdates": "From the 2025-dated resources in the search results, notable compliance-related points include: (1) Registration thresholds remain widely communicated as ₹40 lakh for goods and ₹20 lakh for services in most States, with lower thresholds of ₹20 lakh (goods) and ₹10 lakh (services) for special category States (Kladana, Razorpay, ProAnalyser, GST MSME booklet). (2) Several 2025 articles reconfirm the mainstream return filing pattern: for monthly filers with turnover exceeding ₹5 crore, GSTR-1 is due on the 11th and GSTR-3B on the 20th of each month (Rajendra & Co, DMI Finance, Razorpay November 2025 guide). (3) The GST Portal FAQ (official) clarifies that for quarterly GSTR-3B filers, the due dates are the 22nd and 24th days of the month following the quarter, allocated to different groups of States/UTs, a pattern echoed in Delhi’s due date table. (4) Multiple 2025 GST calendars and IndiaFilings posts document specific due date extensions around January 2025: GSTR-7 and GSTR-8 extended to 12 January 2025; monthly GSTR-1 extended to 13 January 2025; quarterly GSTR-1 extended to 15 January 2025; monthly GSTR-3B extended to 22 January 2025; quarterly GSTR-3B extended to 24 and 26 January 2025 depending on State group. (5) GimBooks’ December 2025 article summarises that the key filing dates for that month are: 10 December for GSTR-7 and GSTR-8, 11 December for GSTR-1, 13 December for GSTR-5, GSTR-6 and IFF, and 20 December for major payment returns such as GSTR-3B. (6) The 2025 penalty guides (DMI Finance, TCS iON, Razorpay, Open.money, SSCO India, ClearTax) consistently present an aligned late fee structure: ₹50 per day (₹25+₹25) for non‑Nil returns, ₹20 per day (₹10+₹10) for Nil returns, with a cap of ₹5,000 per return, interest on delayed tax at 18% per annum, interest on wrongful ITC at 24% per annum, and interest on delayed refunds at 6% per annum when not granted within 60 days (Tax2win). (7) DMI Finance notes that from July 2025 there are additional developments affecting penalty computation for late filing (the snippet says, 'From July 2025, all taxpayers ...' but truncates the details), signalling that taxpayers should carefully review mid‑2025 updates in that guide and check corresponding official notifications for any revised caps or structures from that date. (8) A Taxtmi forum post from May 2025 highlights enforcement practice where GST authorities in many States levy a penalty of ₹50,000 under Section 125 for even a one‑day delay in GSTR-3B filing, underscoring a tightening of compliance enforcement. (9) Several 2025 MSME‑oriented guides (ProAnalyser, LegalWiz, Razorpay, Kladana) emphasise that GST compliance – including timely returns, accurate invoicing and ITC management – remains a critical regulatory focus area for SMEs, with no relaxation in core thresholds or fundamental obligations."

It captures, for each employee, details such as Universal Account Number (UAN), wage month, EPF/EPS/EDLI wages, employee and employer contributions, and exit details where applicable. Up to wage month August 2025, employers used the existing ('legacy') ECR module on the EPFO employer portal to upload a text file or enter data online, generate the EPF challan, and pay contributions electronically.

          "penalty": "If an employer does not complete the ECR filing and corresponding payment by the statutory due date (15th of the following month), two types of statutory financial consequences apply, in addition to potential prosecution for severe defaults:\n\n1) Interest under Section 7Q of the EPF Act (for delay in payment):\n- As stated in the EPFO ComplianceLetter_08102025, 'Interest under Section 7Q becomes automatically applicable (for delay in payment) and is computed by the system.'\n- Guidance materials (Bajaj Finserv 'Provident Fund (PF) Due Dates in India & Late Payment ...', EPFO FAQ page, Wisemonk penalties FAQ) indicate that the statutory interest rate under Section 7Q is 12% per annum on the unpaid amount, calculated as simple interest from the date the contribution became due (the day after the due date, i.e., from the 16th of the following month) until the date of actual payment.\n- The interest is automatically calculated by the EPFO system when the delayed payment is made; it is not discretionary and is payable in addition to any damages under Section 14B.\n- Approximate daily rate: 12% per annum ≈ 12/365 ≈ 0.0329% per day on the outstanding amount.\n\n2) Damages (penal charges) under Section 14B of the EPF Act (for default in payment):\n- The EPFO FAQ (official) states that 'The employer shall be charged penal interest under section 7Q and penal damages under section 14B of the Act respectively.' These damages are a penalty intended to deter and punish late payment.\n- Historical slab system (pre–14 June 2024): As per guidance sources such as ClearTax ('EPF Payment Online'), LabourLawAdvisor ('EPF Interest & Damages On Late Payment Of Challan') and Bajaj Finserv ('Provident Fund (PF) Due Dates in India & Late Payment ...'), damages under Section 14B were earlier levied on a slab basis on the arrears:\n  • Delay up to 2 months: 5% per annum\n  • Delay for 2–4 months: 10% per annum\n  • Delay for 4–6 months: 15% per annum\n  • Delay for more than 6 months: 25% per annum\n  These slab rates (5% to 25% per annum) are still reflected in some older guidance articles and in the Acuity Law note ('EPFO: Revision to rate of damages payable by employers') describing the earlier regime.\n- Revised damages (effective 14 June 2024 onward): As per the Ascent HR notification 'Reduction of penal damages under EPF, EPS, and EDLI ...' and corroborated by the Wisemonk penalties FAQ, the EPFO has, with effect from 14 June 2024, reduced penal damages to a uniform rate of 1% per month for EPF, EPS and EDLI, replacing the earlier 5%–25% per annum slabs. The Ascent HR source notes: 'Penal damages for EPF, EPS, and EDLI were reduced to 1% per month, effective June 14, 2024, from 5% to 25% previously. Interest remains at 12% ...'. Wisemonk summarises this as 'EPF Penalties: 1% monthly damages + 12% interest post-June 2024; imprisonment for severe defaults.'\n  • The 1% per month is generally interpreted as 1% of the arrears for each month or part of a month of delay, i.e., approximately 12% per annum equivalent. It is levied in addition to 12% p.a. interest under Section 7Q.\n  • No explicit statutory maximum amount per challan is specified in the search results; damages are proportional to the arrears and duration of default, subject to EPFO’s powers (e.g., possible waivers or reductions in certain limited circumstances as per the Act and EPFO policy).\n\n3) Combined impact and example calculation (post–14 June 2024 regime):\n- Assume an employer fails to pay ₹100,000 of EPF contributions for wage month April 2025 by the due date of 15 May 2025, and instead pays on 25 June 2025 (41 days late).\n- Interest under Section 7Q at 12% p.a.:\n  • Interest period: 16 May 2025 to 25 June 2025 (41 days).\n  • Interest = ₹100,000 × 12% × (41/365) ≈ ₹100,000 × 0.12 × 0.1123 ≈ ₹1,347 (approx. ₹1,350).\n- Damages under Section 14B at 1% per month:\n  • Delay spans parts of two months (May and June), so effectively 2 months of delay.\n  • Damages = ₹100,000 × 1% × 2 = ₹2,000.\n- Total statutory financial impact (excluding any prosecution risk) ≈ ₹3,350 in this simplified illustration.\n\n4) Prosecution and non-monetary consequences:\n- The Wisemonk penalties FAQ notes that, beyond interest and damages, 'imprisonment for severe defaults' is possible. Under the EPF Act, wilful non-payment of contributions or repeated default can lead to criminal prosecution and imprisonment of responsible persons, in addition to recovery of dues, interest and damages.\n\n5) Key points for SMEs:\n- Interest under Section 7Q is automatic and non-discretionary; the EPFO system calculates it upon delayed payment, as confirmed in the ComplianceLetter_08102025 snippet.\n- Damages under Section 14B have, from 14 June 2024 onward, been standardized at 1% per month (for EPF, EPS and EDLI), replacing the earlier higher slab rates of 5%–25% per annum that are still visible in older guidance pages.\n- There is no separate per-day late fee; the effective daily cost is captured by the 12% p.a. interest plus the monthly 1% damages."

As confirmed in the ComplianceLetter_08102025, this interest 'becomes automatically applicable (for delay in payment) and is computed by the system.'\n\n2) Damages under Section 14B at 1% per month of delay (from 14 June 2024 onwards) for EPF, EPS and EDLI contributions, replacing the earlier slab-based damages of 5%–25% per annum reported in older guidance. The Ascent HR notification and Wisemonk penalties FAQ confirm that the current rate is 1% per month plus 12% interest post-June 2024.\n\n3) For the special case of wage month September 2025, because EPFO expressly extended the filing deadline to 22 October 2025 via the PIB press release PRID=2178587 and other official communications, interest and damages would only start accruing for payments made after 22 October 2025 (i.e., from 23 October 2025) instead of from 16 October 2025.

        "employer": "Standard rate: For most covered establishments with 20 or more employees, the employer must contribute 12% of each covered employee's 'PF wages' (generally basic wages plus dearness allowance and retaining allowance, if any, and the cash value of food concessions, in line with the EPF Act definition). This is supported by multiple 2025 guidance sources, including Paytm's 'EPF Contribution Guide', Axis Bank's EPF article, Bajaj Finserv's 'How to Calculate Your Employer's EPF Contribution', and the Wisemonk FAQ on EPF rules in India 2025, all of which describe an employer contribution of 12% of the salary (typically basic + DA). The EPFO 'Present Rates of Contribution' PDF confirms the standard contribution rate of 12% and also notes a concessional 10% rate for certain establishments.\n\nBreak-up of the employer's 12% contribution (standard scenario):\n- 8.33% of PF wages is allocated to the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS), subject to the EPS wage ceiling (currently ₹15,000 per month), as reflected in BharatPayroll's 'EPFO Contribution Rate 2025' ('8.33% goes to the Employees Pension Scheme (EPS). It pays pension benefits.') and in multiple guidance sources (Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv, ClearTax's 'EPF Interest Rate' article which uses 8.33% of ₹15,000 in its 2025 calculation example).\n- The balance (12% − 8.33% = 3.67% of PF wages, plus any part of the 8.33% calculated on wages above the EPS ceiling) is credited to the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) account. BharatPayroll summarises this as '3.67% goes to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). It grows the retirement savings.'\n\nConcessional rate establishments (10% contribution):\n- The EPFO 'Present Rates of Contribution' PDF (ContributionRate.pdf) snippet states: 'EMPLOYEE 12% /10% ## 10% rate is applicable for • Any establishment in which less than 20 employees are employed. EPF Administrative charges is rounded. The ...'. This indicates that certain establishments, such as those with fewer than 20 employees (and other categories notified under the Act), may contribute at a reduced statutory rate of 10% of PF wages instead of 12%, with a corresponding 10% employee contribution. The detailed list of eligible industries is in the official PDF; the search snippets specifically highlight the employee-count condition.\n\nAdditional employer outgo (administrative and insurance):\n- Although not fully detailed in the snippets, the EPFO 'Present Rates of Contribution' PDFs historically include employer contributions towards the Employees' Deposit-Linked Insurance (EDLI) Scheme (typically 0.5% of wages subject to a wage ceiling) and EPF administrative charges (historically around 0.5% of PF wages, subject to minimum amounts per establishment). The snippet 'EPF Administrative charges is rounded. The ...' confirms the existence of such charges in the current schedule, though the exact percentages and minimums are not fully visible in the search results. SMEs should refer directly to the latest 'ContributionRate.pdf' on epfindia.gov.in to confirm the current EDLI rate and EPF administrative charges applicable in 2025.",
        "employee": "The employee's mandatory EPF contribution is ordinarily 12% of monthly PF wages, mirroring the employer's standard rate, as explained in Paytm's 'EPF Contribution Guide' ('The employee contribution is fixed at 12% of the sum of basic salary and DA. The employer also contributes an equal amount of 12%.') and in Shriram Finance's FAQ ('The EPF contribution rate for employees is 12% of basic salary and dearness allowance, with exceptions for certain establishments at 10%.'). In establishments eligible for the concessional rate, the employee contributes 10% instead of 12%, aligned with the EPFO 'Present Rates of Contribution' PDF which references 'EMPLOYEE 12% /10%' and a 10% rate for establishments with fewer than 20 employees.\n\nVoluntary Provident Fund (VPF):\n- The EPFO ComplianceLetter_08102025 explicitly notes: 'An employee can contribute more than 12% as Voluntary Provident Fund. (VPF) in their Provident Fund (PF) account, but the employer has the ...' (the remainder of the sentence is truncated in the snippet, but standard rules are that the employer is not required to match contributions beyond the statutory rate). This confirms that employees may voluntarily contribute more than the mandatory 12%, typically up to 100% of basic wages and DA, and such voluntary contributions are credited to the EPF account and earn the same rate of interest as mandatory contributions. Employers are not obligated to contribute more than the statutory employer rate (12% or 10%, as applicable) even if an employee opts for higher voluntary contributions.\n\nSpecial notes:\n- Guidance from the Wisemonk 'EPF rules in India 2025' FAQ reiterates that 'EPF contributions are mandatory for employers with 20+ employees, with 12% each from employer and employee.' It further states that 'The 2025 updates eliminate the ₹15,000 salary cap ...', which is understood as referring to the earlier practice of capping EPF contributions on wages of ₹15,000 per month; this suggests contributions should now be computed on full basic plus DA where higher than ₹15,000. However, as the underlying EPFO circular text is not visible in the snippets, employers should verify the operative wage basis directly from the latest official EPFO communications.",
        "calculation": "High-level calculation method for a typical month (post-14 June 2024 regime, standard 12% rate):\n\nStep 1 – Determine PF wages: Identify each covered employee's monthly 'PF wages'. Guidance pages (Paytm, Shriram Finance, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv) uniformly suggest using the sum of basic salary and dearness allowance (DA) as the base for EPF calculations; in legal terms, PF wages are generally basic wages plus DA and retaining allowance (if any) and the cash value of food concessions.\n\nStep 2 – Compute employee contribution:\n- Standard establishments: Employee contribution = 12% of PF wages.\n- Concessional rate establishments (eligible for 10%): Employee contribution = 10% of PF wages.\n- If the employee has opted for Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF), add any voluntary amount above the mandatory 12% (or 10%) contribution, up to the limit permitted by EPFO (typically up to 100% of basic + DA). The entire voluntary amount is credited to the EPF account.\n\nStep 3 – Compute employer contribution (EPF + EPS):\n- Determine the applicable contribution rate (12% or 10%).\n- Apply the rate to PF wages to get the total employer contribution.\n- Split the employer contribution between EPS and EPF:\n  • EPS portion = 8.33% of PF wages, but only up to the EPS wage ceiling of ₹15,000 per month (maximum EPS contribution is therefore 8.33% × ₹15,000 = ₹1,250 per month per employee). This EPS split and ceiling are expressly illustrated in the ClearTax 'EPF Interest Rate' 2025 example ('Employer contribution to EPS (8.33% of Rs. 15,000): ...') and in BharatPayroll's 'EPFO Contribution Rate 2025' ('8.33% goes to the Employees Pension Scheme (EPS).').\n  • EPF employer portion = Total employer contribution − EPS portion. In practice, for an employee earning above ₹15,000 per month, the EPS portion is capped at ₹1,250, and any remaining employer contribution (beyond ₹1,250) goes entirely to the EPF account.\n\nStep 4 – Add EDLI and administrative charges (employer only):\n- As per EPFO's 'Present Rates of Contribution' schedule (ContributionRate.pdf), the employer must also pay EDLI contribution and EPF administrative charges. While the snippets do not show the exact 2025 percentages, historically these have been around 0.5% of wages for EDLI (subject to the wage ceiling) and 0.5% of PF wages as EPF administrative charges, as indicated by the phrase 'EPF Administrative charges is rounded. The ...' in the EPFO PDF snippet. These charges are computed on eligible wages and added to the employer’s outgo but are not deducted from employees.\n\nSimple numeric illustration (based on typical 2025 guidance) – Employee with PF wages of ₹25,000 per month in a standard 12% establishment:\n- Employee contribution: 12% of ₹25,000 = ₹3,000 (all to EPF; may be higher if VPF elected).\n- Employer total contribution: 12% of ₹25,000 = ₹3,000.\n  • EPS portion: 8.33% of ₹15,000 (capped) = ₹1,250 to EPS.\n  • EPF employer portion: ₹3,000 − ₹1,250 = ₹1,750 to EPF.\n- Total credited to EPF account for the month: Employee ₹3,000 + Employer EPF ₹1,750 = ₹4,750.\n- Total credited to EPS: ₹1,250.\n- Employer additionally pays EDLI and EPF administrative charges as per EPFO's current rate schedule (exact percentages to be verified in ContributionRate.pdf).\n\nThis structure is consistent with the guidance examples on ClearTax (EPF interest calculation 2025), Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv, BharatPayroll 2025 and other sources in the search results.",
        "wageCeiling": "EPS wage ceiling (current): The statutory wage ceiling for the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS) is ₹15,000 per month. Accordingly, the maximum EPS contribution is 8.33% × ₹15,000 = ₹1,250 per month per employee. ClearTax's 2025 interest example explicitly uses 'Employer contribution to EPS (8.33% of Rs. 15,000)' to illustrate this cap, and BharatPayroll and Axis Bank articles reiterate the same concept.\n\nHistorical EPF contribution wage ceilings (from EPFO 'Present Rates of Contribution_till04012016.pdf' and later practice):\n- The older EPFO contribution rate PDF ('ContributionRate_till04012016.pdf') snippet states: 'The contributions are payable on maximum wage ceiling of Rs 6500/- by employee ...', indicating that prior to subsequent amendments, contributions were capped on wages of ₹6,500 per month. This is a historical threshold and no longer applies at current rates.\n- Subsequent updates (not fully reproduced in the snippets but well recognised in practice) increased the wage ceiling from ₹6,500 to ₹15,000 per month.\n\n2025 guidance on salary cap removal for EPF contributions: The Wisemonk FAQ 'What are EPF rules in India 2025 & how the system operates' states: 'EPF contributions are mandatory for employers with 20+ employees, with 12% each from employer and employee.' It further notes: 'The 2025 updates eliminate the ₹15,000 salary cap ...'. While the snippet does not show the full sentence, the context indicates that the prior practice of limiting EPF contributions (especially for higher-salaried employees) to a wage base of ₹15,000 per month has been removed, suggesting that, for EPF (as distinct from EPS), contributions should be computed on full basic pay plus DA even where wages exceed ₹15,000. The EPS wage ceiling of ₹15,000 remains in place for the 8.33% pension contribution component. Because the underlying EPFO notification text is not included in the snippets, SMEs should confirm the operative wage ceiling policy directly from the latest EPFO circulars and internal counsel; however, the guidance in the search results clearly signals a 2025 shift away from the ₹15,000 cap for EPF contribution calculations."

        "registration": "Employers become liable for EPF registration once they employ 20 or more persons in a covered industry or class of establishments. Registration is done through the EPFO's unified employer portal (https://www.epfindia.gov.in), where the establishment obtains an EPF establishment code. The employer must provide details such as legal name, address, type of establishment, date of coverage, number of employees, PAN, bank details, and responsible persons. Registration should be completed within the period prescribed after crossing the threshold (commonly treated as within one month of attaining coverage). Voluntary coverage is possible for establishments with fewer than 20 employees, subject to consent and notification. Once granted, coverage continues even if headcount falls below the threshold. Employees are enrolled and allotted Universal Account Numbers (UANs) through the employer portal; the UAN is used in the monthly ECR to credit contributions to individual accounts.",
        "renewal": "There is no periodic renewal requirement for EPF registration. Once an establishment is covered and allotted an EPF code, coverage is continuous as long as the establishment exists and employs covered employees. However, employers must:\n- File monthly ECR and make contributions for all eligible employees.\n- Update establishment details (e.g., name change, address, ownership, authorised signatories) in the EPFO records when changes occur.\n- Maintain records and comply with inspections and audits by EPFO as required.\nCancellation or closure of the code (for example, on permanent closure of business) requires following EPFO’s formal exit/closure procedures.",
        "filingMethod": "EPF ECR filing is an online process via the EPFO employer portal only.\n\nLegacy ECR (up to wage month August 2025):\n- Employers prepared a text file in the prescribed format or entered data online through the portal, containing each employee's UAN, name, PF wages, contribution amounts, and exit details.\n- The file was uploaded through the 'ECR Upload' functionality, validated by the system, and upon successful validation, a challan was generated.\n- Payment was made electronically via internet banking or other integrated payment modes through EPFO-authorised banks.\n\nRevamped ECR (from wage month September 2025 onwards):\n- As per the 'Revamped ECR' page on epfindia.gov.in and the ECRRevamp_26092025 circular, EPFO introduced a revamped ECR module to 'streamline the return filing process for employers and establishments through the EPFO's employer ...', with key features aimed at simplifying and enhancing user experience.\n- Employers must now use the revamped ECR interface for wage month September 2025 and later, accessed via the EPFO employer portal. The PIB press release and multiple guidance sources emphasise that the extension to 22 October 2025 was granted specifically to aid this transition.\n- Filing continues to be completely electronic; there is no mention in the 2025 search results of any offline/manual ECR filing mechanism for general establishments.\n\nIn all cases, the ECR filing and payment are linked: the challan is generated directly from the data in the ECR, and payment is done against that challan. Timely ECR filing is therefore inseparable from timely contribution remittance for compliance purposes.",
        "prerequisites": "Before an SME can successfully file EPF ECRs and remain compliant, several prerequisites must be in place:\n- Valid EPF establishment code obtained via registration on the EPFO employer portal.\n- Up-to-date employer master data on the portal (address, contact details, authorised signatory, bank details, etc.).\n- Universal Account Numbers (UANs) for all covered employees, linked to the employer’s establishment. Each employee must have KYC details (such as PAN, Aadhaar, bank account) seeded and verified in the EPFO system to allow seamless crediting of contributions.\n- Accurate employee payroll data each month, including PF-eligible wages (basic + DA and other includible components), EPS wage, EDLI wage and applicable contribution splits.\n- Digital signature certificate (DSC) or eSign capability for certain employer actions (e.g., approving KYC, statutory returns beyond the monthly ECR).\n- Awareness of the current contribution rates and ceilings from the EPFO 'Present Rates of Contribution' PDF, including any updates affecting administrative charges and EDLI contributions.\n- Internal processes to ensure that contributions are calculated correctly and that the ECR and payment are completed on or before the statutory due date (15th of the following month, or extended dates where officially notified).",
        "recentUpdates": "Key updates and clarifications relevant to EPF ECR compliance as reflected in the 2024–2025 search results:\n\n1) Reduction of penal damages under Section 14B (effective 14 June 2024):\n- As recorded in the Ascent HR notification 'Reduction of penal damages under EPF, EPS, and EDLI payable by employer' and the Wisemonk penalties FAQ, EPFO reduced the penal damages rate for EPF, EPS and EDLI from the earlier slab range of 5%–25% per annum to a uniform 1% per month, with effect from 14 June 2024.\n- Interest under Section 7Q remains at 12% per annum on unpaid amounts, as highlighted in Bajaj Finserv's 'Provident Fund (PF) Due Dates in India & Late Payment ...' and other guidance.\n- Older articles (e.g., ClearTax's 'EPF Payment Online', LabourLawAdvisor's blog, Acuity Law's commentary) still show the historical slab system (5%, 10%, 15%, 25% per annum) and should be read as referring to the pre–14 June 2024 period.\n\n2) Automatic system computation of interest under Section 7Q (2025 Compliance Letter):\n- The EPFO ComplianceLetter_08102025 explicitly states that interest under Section 7Q becomes 'automatically applicable (for delay in payment) and is computed by the system.' This underscores that employers cannot avoid Section 7Q interest and that it is not subject to discretionary waiver through the ECR process; the EPFO system will calculate and demand it whenever a payment is late.\n\n3) Clarification on Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) contributions (2025 Compliance Letter):\n- The same ComplianceLetter_08102025 confirms that 'An employee can contribute more than 12% as Voluntary Provident Fund. (VPF) in their Provident Fund (PF) account, but the employer has the ...' (with the implication, consistent with standard rules, that the employer is not obliged to match contributions above the statutory rate). This reiterates that employees may opt for higher contributions without increasing employer liability beyond statutory contributions.\n\n4) Introduction of the revamped ECR module (wage month September 2025 onwards):\n- EPFO announced, via its 'Revamped ECR' official web page and the circular ECRRevamp_26092025, that a new ECR module would be introduced from wage month September 2025 onwards. The objective is to 'streamline the return filing process for employers and establishments through the EPFO's employer ...' and to provide 'simplify and enhance user experience of the return filing process for employers via the EPFO's employer portal', as summarised in the PIB 2025 press release.\n- This revamp changes the interface and workflow for filing but does not, based on the snippets, alter the underlying contribution rates or the basic due-date rule (15th of the following month), other than for specific transitional relief.\n\n5) One-week extension for filing the new ECR for wage month September 2025:\n- In October 2025, EPFO extended the last date to file the new, revamped ECR for wage month September 2025 to 22 October 2025. This is confirmed by:\n  • PIB press release with PRID=2178587 (13 October 2025), which states that 'EPFO Extends date of filing of new ECR up to 22nd October ...' and explains that the revamped system aims to simplify filing and that the extension was granted to aid transition.\n  • EPFO’s official Facebook announcement: 'The last date to file the new ECR for September 2025 has been extended till 22nd October 2025. The revamped system ensures easier ...'.\n  • Multiple media and professional updates (CAalley, Times of India, Saral.pro, CNBC-TV18, Legality Simplified) which describe the 'one-week extension' and revised deadline of 22 October 2025 for September 2025 wage month ECR.\n- This extension is a one-time transitional relief and does not permanently alter the general 15th-of-next-month rule for other months.\n\n6) 2025 guidance regarding elimination of the ₹15,000 salary cap for EPF contributions:\n- The Wisemonk FAQ 'What are the legal requirements for EPF contributions in India and how does the EPF system operate' contains the statement: 'EPF contributions are mandatory for employers with 20+ employees, with 12% each from employer and employee.' It further states: 'The 2025 updates eliminate the ₹15,000 salary cap ...', indicating that recent regulatory practice removes the earlier limitation where contributions for higher-salaried employees could be restricted to a base of ₹15,000 per month.\n- The search snippet does not include the underlying EPFO circular or full explanation, but this guidance suggests that in 2025 EPFO expects contributions to be calculated on full basic pay plus DA for EPF (subject to EPS retaining its ₹15,000 ceiling), and that the use of a fixed ₹15,000 base for contribution calculation is no longer acceptable for ongoing contributions.\n- SMEs should cross-check with the latest EPFO circulars or advisories to confirm how precisely this salary-cap removal is to be implemented in their payroll systems.\n\n7) Interest on EPF accumulations (investment return, not penalty):\n- The EPFO official document 'INTEREST RATE DECLARED ON PROVIDENT FUND ACCUMULATIONS SINCE 1952' (InterestRate_OnPFAccumulationsSince1952.pdf) shows historical interest rates on EPF balances, noting that they began at 3.00% in 1952–53, reached 12.00% in 1989–90, and were 8.15% in 2022–23. The search results do not provide the declared rates for 2023–24 or 2024–25, so SMEs must consult the latest EPFO notifications to know the current EPF interest rate used for crediting annual interest to member accounts.\n\n8) Clarification on penalties vs. interest (guidance consolidation in 2025):\n- Multiple 2025 guidance sources (Wisemonk, Bajaj Finserv, ClearTax, LabourLawAdvisor, Acuity Law, CrazeHQ) collectively clarify that:\n  • Interest for late payment is a statutory 12% per annum under Section 7Q and continues to apply regardless of the change in damages structure.\n  • Damages (penalties) under Section 14B were historically 5%–25% per annum based on duration of delay, but have been replaced, for EPF, EPS and EDLI, by a uniform rate of 1% per month effective 14 June 2024.\n  • Significant or repeated non-compliance can lead to prosecution and potential imprisonment of responsible persons under the EPF Act.\n\nFor SMEs, these updates mean that: (a) timely ECR filing and payment are more critical than ever because interest is system-computed and unavoidable; (b) although penal damages have been reduced to 1% per month, the combination of 12% interest plus 1% monthly damages still represents a substantial cost of non-compliance; (c) the revamped ECR system and salary-cap guidance in 2025 may require payroll and system configuration changes to ensure that contributions are calculated on the correct wage base and that the new ECR format is used correctly."

          "penalty": "Late or non-payment of monthly ESI contributions attracts both interest and damages, and can lead to prosecution. Based on the 2025 guidance sources (ClearTax Online ESI Return Filing article, EbizFiling penalty article, Kanakkupillai article on filing after due date, Mahajan Consultancy article on PF & ESI penalties, Wisemonk EPF & ESI penalties FAQ, and ESIC FAQ booklet):\n\n1. Interest on delayed contributions: Employers are liable to pay simple interest at 12% per annum on the contribution amount for the period of delay. EbizFiling explicitly states 'simple interest at the rate of 12% per year for each day' of delay; Kanakkupillai also notes '12% per annum on the contribution amount, calculated monthly'; Mahajan Consultancy and Wisemonk reiterate 12% p.a. This interest is effectively calculated on a day-to-day basis as 12%/365 on the unpaid amount. There is no separate statutory flat late fee per day; the time-dependent component is through this interest rate.\n\n2. Damages (penal charges): ClearTax's ESI return filing article provides a detailed slab of damages (often referred to as 'damages under Section 85B/Regulation 31C') applied on the amount in arrears:\n   - Period of delay less than 2 months: 5% per annum\n   - Period of delay from 2 months to less than 4 months: 10% per annum\n   - Period of delay from 4 months to less than 6 months: 15% per annum\n   - Period of delay of 6 months and above: 25% per annum\n   Wisemonk summarizes this as '5–25% damages' in addition to 12% interest. These damages are normally levied by ESIC through a speaking order and are computed on the contribution amount in default for the relevant delay period, commonly on a monthly or part-of-month basis.\n   Some private guidance (Mahajan Consultancy) also refers generically to penal damages of '1% per month on the outstanding', which approximates 12% per annum; however, the more detailed 5–25% p.a. slab as given by ClearTax is consistent with ESIC regulations and should be relied upon for precise computation.\n\n3. Late fee per day: There is no fixed rupee 'late fee per day' prescribed in the search results or under the standard ESIC framework; the effective daily burden is derived from 12% annual interest plus slab-based damages.\n\n4. Minimum and maximum penalties: The 2025 search results and typical ESIC regulations do not specify a fixed minimum or maximum rupee penalty cap. Interest and damages are proportional to the amount due and the duration of delay, so there is effectively no statutory overall maximum; the liability increases as the outstanding amount and the delay period increase.\n\n5. Calculation method (illustrative example from the guidance): If Rs. 100,000 of ESI contribution for April 2025 is paid 3 months late (e.g., paid on 15 August 2025 instead of 15 May 2025), interest at 12% per annum would be approximately Rs. 3,000 (100,000 × 12% × 3/12). Damages for a 3-month delay fall in the '2 to 4 months' slab at 10% p.a., giving damages of about Rs. 2,500 (100,000 × 10% × 3/12). Total monetary consequence ≈ Rs. 5,500, aside from any prosecution-related fines.\n\n6. Legal prosecution and other consequences: Wisemonk notes that ESI penalties can include 'jail terms up to 2 years'. The official ESIC FAQ booklet highlights that where employees’ contributions have been deducted from wages but not deposited, the failure is treated seriously; ESIC can initiate prosecution, and courts can impose imprisonment (up to 2 years in serious cases) and fines. CAClubIndia similarly notes that non-compliance (even for nil returns in some contexts) may lead to legal prosecution and court summons.\n\nIn summary, for monthly ESI contribution payments, the key penalty components are: interest rate 12% per annum, damages at 5–25% per annum depending on delay slab, no fixed per-day rupee late fee, and no explicit statutory maximum cap, with potential criminal liability in cases of willful default or misappropriation of deducted employee contributions."

          "penalty": "Penalties for delay or non-filing of the monthly ESI return are closely tied to the penalties for delayed contribution payment, because in the current ESIC system return filing is functionally integrated with payment:\n\n1. Where contributions are unpaid or underpaid: Failure to file the return generally also implies failure to pay the full contributions. In such cases, interest at 12% per annum and slab-based damages at 5–25% per annum (as described for monthly contribution payment) will apply on the contribution shortfall for the duration of delay. The effective late fee per day is embedded in this interest and damages; there is no separate flat per-day fee. No minimum or maximum rupee cap is specified in the 2025 snippets.\n\n2. Where contributions are fully paid on time but the return is filed late: The 2025 snippets do not provide a separate numerical penalty schedule specifically for late filing of a return where there is no monetary default. However, the ESIC FAQ booklet and CAClubIndia article on 'Legal consequences of Not Filing ESIC Nil Return on Time' emphasize that non-filing or late filing of returns (even when there is no contribution payable) can still lead to penalty and interest charges, legal prosecution, and court summons. In practice, ESIC may issue show-cause notices and can impose penalties and eventually prosecution under the ESI Act’s general contravention provisions. The exact rupee quantum of such non-monetary penalties is not quantified in the snippets.\n\n3. Nil or zero-contribution months: CAClubIndia specifically addresses 'ESIC Nil Return' and notes that failure to file such returns on time can attract (a) penalty and interest charges, (b) legal prosecution and court summons, and (c) other consequences such as difficulties in getting NOCs/clearances. Since no contributions are due, interest and damages do not accrue on any principal, but ESIC can still invoke general penalties for default in statutory return filing.\n\n4. Legal consequences: As with contribution payment, willful non-filing or persistent default in return submission can support prosecution, with potential imprisonment up to 2 years and fines (Wisemonk’s general description of ESI penalties). No separate daily or maximum late fee for monthly return filing is specified in the 2025 search results."

These half-yearly returns summarise employee-wise wages and contributions for the periods: (1) April 1st to September 30th, and (2) October 1st to March 31st. Historically, these returns were filed in prescribed forms and provided a consolidated view of contributions. Some guidance sources continue to describe these half-yearly returns in 2025, although many employers now rely primarily on the monthly online return/challan system.",

            "type": "fixed",
            "day": null,
            "formula": "The 2025 guidance sources provide differing deadlines for half-yearly returns, suggesting that practice and interpretation vary and/or that older dates are being repeated:\n- IndiaFilings and Udyog Suvidha Kendra: They state that ESIC mandates half-yearly returns and that returns from April 1st to September 30th must be filed by 11th November. By implication (though truncated in the snippet), returns for the period October to March are generally described as being due by 11th May.\n- ClearTax: It states that the half-yearly return for April to September is due by 12th November, and for October to March is due by 12th May.\n- Udyog Suvidha Kendra (explicit snippet): 'April to September – Due by 11th November; For the period October to ...' (standard practice suggests October to March – due by 11th May).\n- RegisterKaro: It states: 'File Returns: Every six months, employers must file ESIC returns. The due dates for filing returns are: April to September: Due by October 31st.' It does not, in the snippet, specify the deadline for October–March, but by symmetry would likely place it around April or May of the following year.\n\nIn summary, widely cited due dates in 2025 guidance are:\n- For the half-year April 1st–September 30th: 31 October, 11 November, or 12 November (varying by source).\n- For the half-year October 1st–March 31st: 11 May or 12 May (widely referenced, though not always fully visible in snippets).\nBecause of these inconsistencies and the shift toward monthly online returns, many SMEs now either do not file separate half-yearly returns or rely on ESIC portal instructions for whether a half-yearly consolidation is still required. The safest assumption, where half-yearly returns are still mandated by ESIC or local office practice, is that they are due in early-to-mid November (for April–September) and early-to-mid May (for October–March), and employers should verify the exact due dates from the ESIC portal or latest circulars.",

          },
          "penalty": "The 2025 search results do not provide a distinct numerical penalty schedule exclusively for late filing of half-yearly ESIC returns separate from monthly payment/return obligations. However, the following principles can be drawn from the articles and official FAQ:\n\n1. If half-yearly returns are not filed but monthly contributions have been fully and timely paid: In this scenario, interest (12% p.a.) and damages (5–25% p.a.) on contributions would not ordinarily apply, because there is no contribution shortfall. However, failure to file a statutory return is still a contravention under the ESI Act. The ESIC FAQ booklet and the CAClubIndia article on non-filing of ESIC nil returns make clear that late or non-filing can attract penalties and prosecution. The specific rupee penalties for such procedural default are not quantified in the 2025 snippets, but they may be levied under the Act’s general penalty provisions (e.g., fines per offense and additional fines for continuing default).\n\n2. If half-yearly returns are not filed and contributions are also unpaid or short-paid: Then the same monetary penalties as for monthly contribution defaults will apply (interest at 12% p.a. and slab-based damages at 5–25% p.a. as summarized by ClearTax and Wisemonk) on the unpaid contributions, along with potential prosecution.\n\n3. Daily late fee, minimum and maximum penalties: No dedicated daily late fee or minimum/maximum rupee caps specific to half-yearly returns are described in the 2025 search results. The effective financial exposure is driven by whether contribution amounts have been underpaid and the general contravention penalties for failure to furnish returns, plus potential prosecution and fines.\n\n4. Legal consequences: CAClubIndia mentions that non-filing of ESIC returns (including nil returns) can result in: (i) penalty and interest charges, (ii) legal prosecution and court summons, and (iii) further adverse consequences related to compliance history. The ESIC FAQ emphasizes that where employee contributions have been deducted and not paid, the offense is especially serious and subject to prosecution and recovery. Imprisonment of up to 2 years is cited by Wisemonk as a possible outcome for serious ESI non-compliance."

If ESIC in a particular case still mandates half-yearly returns, a nil half-yearly return would be due on the half-yearly due dates applicable for that establishment (for example, in early-to-mid November and early-to-mid May, as indicated by IndiaFilings, ClearTax, Udyog Suvidha Kendra, and RegisterKaro).",

Because there is no contribution amount in arrears for a true nil period, interest at 12% p.a. and damages at 5–25% p.a. do not practically arise; instead, the default is of a procedural nature (failure to file a statutory return). The ESI Act provides for fines for such contraventions, and persistent default can lead to prosecution. However, the 2025 search results do not specify exact rupee amounts, daily late fees, or minimum/maximum penalties specifically for nil returns.

Multiple 2025 guidance sources (ClearTax ESI Rate 2024-2025 article, HROne 2025-26 ESI contribution blog, Scripbox ESI calculation article, MyFlowSoft 2025 employer & employee guide, Empxtrack payroll rules) confirm that this 3.25% employer rate remains applicable for FY 2024-25 and 2025-26.",

ClearTax's 2025 ESI rate article, Scripbox, HROne, MyFlowSoft, and Empxtrack all confirm that the employee contribution continues to be 0.75% for FY 2024-25 and 2025-26.",
        "calculation": "The 2025 search results collectively describe the following calculation mechanics:\n\n1. Determine coverage and wage base:\n   - Coverage: As per ESIC Coverage guidance, employees with monthly wages up to Rs. 21,000 (Rs. 25,000 for Persons with Disability) are generally within the scope of ESI. Empxtrack's summary (truncated in the snippet) and other standard ESI guidance indicate that employees earning above the ceiling are excluded at the time of first coverage.\n   - Wages: HROne's 2025-26 ESI contribution article notes that 'The employees get 0.75% deducted from their respective gross salaries, whereas the employers make an ESI contribution of 3.25% of the employee's gross pay'. Empxtrack, Scripbox, and other sources similarly apply the rates to 'wages' or 'gross pay'. Under the ESI Act, 'wages' broadly include all remuneration paid or payable in cash to an employee if the terms of the contract are fulfilled, including basic pay, dearness allowance, and most cash allowances, but excluding certain items such as employer PF contributions, gratuity, retrenchment compensation, and some other specific exclusions (these legal details are part of general ESI law and not fully elaborated in the 2025 snippets).\n\n2. Apply contribution rates:\n   - Employee contribution = 0.75% of monthly wages.\n   - Employer contribution = 3.25% of monthly wages.\n   - Combined ESI contribution = 4% of wages (Nishith Desai's research article notes that the overall contribution rate under the ESI Act was reduced from 6.5% to 4%; the ESIC and GEM/GoI documents show that this reduction was achieved by changing rates from 4.75% + 1.75% to 3.25% + 0.75%).\n\n3. Example calculation (as illustrated by HROne, ClearTax, Scripbox, and similar guidance):\n   - Suppose an employee earns Rs. 18,000 per month in April 2025 and is within the coverage wage ceiling.\n   - Employer ESI contribution = 18,000 × 3.25% = Rs. 585.\n   - Employee ESI contribution (deduction from salary) = 18,000 × 0.75% = Rs. 135.\n   - Total ESI contribution for that employee for April 2025 = Rs. 720.\n   - Across the establishment, the employer calculates contributions individually for each covered employee and aggregates them to determine the total contribution to be paid and reported for that month.\n\n4. Timing of deduction and payment:\n   - Employee contribution is deducted from the employee’s wages in the wage month (e.g., April 2025 payslip shows ESI = Rs. 135 deduction in the example above).\n   - Employer must remit both employer and employee contributions (total 4% of ESI wages) to ESIC by the 15th of the following month, as confirmed by SaralPayPack, Digilawyer, TaxGuru, and Suvit compliance calendars.\n\n5. Historical rates (for context):\n   - PHDCCI's PDF and Government e-Marketplace (gem.gov.in) documentation note that, prior to the July 2019 reduction, the total ESI contribution was 6.5%, comprising employer's 4.75% and employee's 1.75%. Nishith Desai's article notes that the rate was reduced to 4% (combined). As of FY 2024-25 and 2025-26, all 2025 guidance sources agree that the current applicable rates remain 3.25% for employers and 0.75% for employees.",
        "wageCeiling": "The official ESIC Coverage page states that the wage ceiling for coverage is Rs. 21,000 per month, with a higher ceiling of Rs. 25,000 per month for Persons with Disability (PWD). Employees whose monthly wages exceed these limits at the time they would be brought under coverage are generally not coverable. Guidance sources such as Empxtrack and general ESI practice indicate that once an employee becomes coverable within a contribution period, contributions typically continue till the end of that contribution period even if wages subsequently cross the ceiling; this continuity principle is part of standard ESI law but not fully spelled out in the provided 2025 snippets."

      ],
      "additionalInfo": {
        "registration": "Employer registration under ESI is mandatory once an establishment meets the coverage criteria (employee-count threshold and notified area). The 2025 search results imply an online-first regime: articles such as 'Online ESI Return Filing: Process, Penalty for Late Filing' (ClearTax), 'ESI Return Filing - Documents Required & Online Procedure' (IndiaFilings), and Udyog Suvidha Kendra’s guidance all emphasise online procedures, which presuppose that employers first obtain an ESIC employer code via the ESIC portal. Standard ESI practice (although not fully spelt out in the snippets) is that employers must register within a short period (traditionally 15 days) from the date ESI becomes applicable to them. Registration requires providing establishment details, address of branches, nature of business, employee count, bank details, and details of responsible persons. Once registered, employers must promptly register all coverable employees on the ESIC portal and begin deducting and remitting contributions from the applicable date.\n\nThe Futurex Solutions article on the 'SPREE Scheme by ESIC 2025' describes a significant registration-related special scheme for 2025: a 6-month window from 1 July 2025 to 31 December 2025 for penalty-free ESI registration by employers that have not yet registered under the ESI Act despite being liable. The article notes that this scheme allows 'penalty-free ESI registration for employers, with no backdated ...', which appears to refer to waiver of backdated penalties and/or damages for earlier non-registration (full wording is truncated in the snippet; the exact scope of waiver, especially regarding backdated contributions and interest, must be confirmed from the official SPREE 2025 circular). This scheme is particularly important for SMEs that inadvertently delayed registration and wish to regularise their status in 2025 with reduced historical penalty exposure.",
        "renewal": "ESI employer registration (the ESIC employer code) is typically a one-time registration and does not require periodic renewal. Once registered, an employer's on-going obligations consist of continuous monthly contribution payment and return filing, periodic updates of employee details, and compliance with inspections and notices. None of the 2025 search results suggest any periodic renewal requirement for the ESI registration itself.",
        "filingMethod": "The filing method highlighted across the 2025 search results is overwhelmingly online:\n- ClearTax's article is titled 'Online ESI Return Filing: Process, Penalty for Late Filing', describing an online process for return filing.\n- IndiaFilings' ESI Return Filing article references an 'Online Procedure', indicating that returns and payments are made via the ESIC portal.\n- Udyog Suvidha Kendra's 'Effortless ESI Return Filing' and Digilawyer's ESI Return Filing service also assume electronic filings.\n- Compliance calendars from TaxGuru, EbizFiling, Suvit, and Jordensky track ESI due dates alongside GST and Income Tax, consistent with web-based filing and payment.\nIn practical terms, employers log in to the ESIC employer portal, register employees, generate monthly contribution challans, and file returns electronically. Physical filing of ESI returns has been largely phased out in favour of online submission. Payment is usually made via net banking/online payment linked to the challan.",
        "prerequisites": "To comply with ESI obligations, an SME employer typically requires: (1) ESIC employer registration code obtained through the ESIC portal; (2) basic establishment details including PAN, address, nature of business, and bank account information; (3) updated list of all employees, with their personal details, wages, dates of joining, and identity details; (4) payroll system capable of calculating ESI contributions at the prevailing rates (employer 3.25%, employee 0.75%) and identifying ESI-eligible employees based on wage ceilings; (5) internet access and credentials for the ESIC portal to file returns and make online payments. Many of the guidance sites (ClearTax, IndiaFilings, Empxtrack, HROne) implicitly assume the existence of such payroll and registration setups in describing how to compute and file ESI returns.",
        "recentUpdates": "The 2025 search results highlight several important current-status and update points relevant to SMEs:\n\n1. Contribution rates unchanged through FY 2024-25 and 2025-26: The official ESIC Contribution page states that with effect from 01.07.2019, the contribution rates are 0.75% for employees and 3.25% for employers. ClearTax's 'ESI Rate 2024-2025' article (dated 21 April 2025) confirms that for FY 2024-25, the employee's rate remains 0.75% of wages and the employer's rate remains 3.25%. HROne's September 2025 article, Scripbox's ESI calculation article, MyFlowSoft's 2025 guide, and Empxtrack's payroll compliance blog all reiterate the same percentages, indicating no changes in ESI contribution rates for FY 2025-26.\n\n2. Wage ceiling and coverage reaffirmed: The ESIC Coverage page explicitly mentions a wage ceiling of Rs. 21,000 per month (Rs. 25,000 for PWD employees) and states that the ESI Scheme is notified in 668 districts across 36 States and Union Territories. While this is not a new 2025 change, it confirms the current coverage framework.\n\n3. Monthly due date practice confirmed for 2025: Multiple 2025 compliance calendars and guidance articles (SaralPayPack, Digilawyer, TaxGuru, Suvit, EbizFiling, Jordensky) confirm that the ESI payment and (where applicable) return filing due date remains the 15th of the month following the wage month throughout 2025. Specific examples include Suvit's listing of '15th September – ESI Payment and Return Filing – For August 2025' and TaxGuru's note that 'payments and returns for September 2025 are due by October 15' under ESI and PF laws.\n\n4. Continued citation of half-yearly returns in 2025: Although ESIC has moved substantially to an online monthly return system, several 2025 guidance sources (ClearTax, IndiaFilings, Udyog Suvidha Kendra, RegisterKaro) still describe half-yearly ESIC returns for April–September and October–March, with due dates ranging between 31 October, 11/12 November, and 11/12 May. This indicates that many SMEs and advisors still treat half-yearly returns as a compliance item, either as a legacy requirement or as a consolidated reporting requirement. However, there is no single agreed due date among these sources, so SMEs should verify with the ESIC portal or local office whether separate half-yearly returns are currently required in addition to monthly online returns.\n\n5. Clarification and emphasis on penalties: The 2025 guidance articles provide a consolidated picture of ESI penalties:\n   - Interest at 12% per annum for delayed contributions (EbizFiling, Kanakkupillai, Mahajan Consultancy, Wisemonk).\n   - Damages at 5–25% per annum depending on period of delay (<2 months: 5%; 2–4 months: 10%; 4–6 months: 15%; ≥6 months: 25%) as per ClearTax's detailed table.\n   - Recognition that penalties apply even for nil return non-filing (CAClubIndia article on ESIC nil returns).\n   - Acknowledgement that serious or willful ESI non-compliance can attract prosecution and imprisonment up to 2 years (Wisemonk summary and ESIC FAQs).\n\n6. SPREE Scheme 2025 (special amnesty window): Futurex Solutions reports that ESIC has launched a SPREE-like scheme in 2025, offering a 6-month window from 1 July 2025 to 31 December 2025 for penalty-free ESI registration for employers that have not registered under the ESI Act but were liable to do so. The snippet notes 'penalty-free ESI registration for employers, with no backdated ...', indicating that backdated penalties and possibly damages are waived for participating employers. The precise conditions (for example, whether past contributions and interest must still be paid, eligibility criteria, whether all industries and States are covered, and whether specific declarations must be made) are not fully visible in the snippet and must be verified from the official ESIC SPREE 2025 notification. For SMEs that discover past non-registration in 2025, this scheme represents a crucial opportunity to regularise without the usual retrospective penal burden.\n\n7. State-specific variations still relevant: Wisemonk's EPF & ESI penalties FAQ notes that 'State Variations: ESI thresholds and leave policies differ across Maharashtra, Karnataka, ...', indicating that while the ESI Act and contribution rates are centrally set, certain implementation aspects such as threshold employee counts for coverage of non-factory establishments and some leave/benefit nuances continue to vary by State. The 2025 snippets do not list these variations exhaustively; SMEs operating in multiple States should therefore cross-check the specific ESI notifications and State labour rules applicable to each location.\n\n8. Historical rate reduction context: PHDCCI and Government e-Marketplace documents, along with Nishith Desai’s article, provide context that ESI contribution rates were historically 6.5% (employer 4.75% + employee 1.75%) and were reduced to a combined 4% (employer 3.25% + employee 0.75%). While this change occurred before 2025, its continued reference in 2025 materials underscores that the reduced rates remain the operative rates as of 2025.\n\nOverall, the 2025 search results confirm that for SMEs in 2025: (a) ESI rates remain 3.25% employer and 0.75% employee on eligible wages, (b) wage ceilings remain Rs. 21,000 (Rs. 25,000 for PWD), (c) monthly payments and returns are due by the 15th of the following month, (d) penalties for non-compliance remain stringent (12% interest plus 5–25% damages, with possible prosecution), and (e) a special SPREE 2025 scheme provides a limited-time opportunity for unregistered employers to regularise without backdated penalties/damages, subject to official scheme conditions."

This is calculated as: Penalty = ₹5 × number of days between the statutory registration deadline and the actual date of registration. No maximum cap is mentioned in the snippets. Example (Maharashtra): If a business was required to obtain PTRC by 10 May 2025 but only registers on 19 June 2025 (40 days late), daily penalty would be approximately ₹5 × 40 = ₹200, in addition to any interest and non‑payment penalties on the tax itself. Ebizfiling’s all‑India PT guidance also cites a ₹5 per day penalty for failure to obtain a Professional Tax Registration Certificate, indicating that similar daily‑fine structures are used in other PT states, though the exact rate should be verified per state.

Example: If annual PTEC is ₹2,500 and payment is made 3 full months after the due date, interest ≈ ₹2,500 × 1.25% × 3 = ₹93.75 (rounded as per department practice), and the late‑payment penalty = 10% × ₹2,500 = ₹250. Total additional liability ≈ ₹343.75, plus any daily registration penalty if enrolment was also delayed. ClearTax notes that Maharashtra may also impose prosecution and other recovery actions in serious cases of non‑payment, though such details are not shown in the snippets and must be checked in the state PT Act."

This refers to employers whose total annual PTRC liability does not exceed ₹50,000; they may pay the entire year’s accumulated PT in a single payment by 31 March of that financial year. Where the annual PTRC liability exceeds ₹50,000, a more frequent schedule (commonly monthly) applies, with earlier due dates prescribed in the Maharashtra PT Rules. The specific monthly due date (for example, last day of the following month) is not visible in the snippets and must be verified from the official schedule or government notifications.",

Step 2: If the total annual PT for all employees is expected to be ₹50,000 or less, you may plan to remit the combined amount once a year, no later than 31 March of that financial year. Example: If an SME’s cumulative PT deducted from employees for FY 2025‑26 is ₹36,000, it can remit this by 31 March 2026, if allowed by the state’s rules at the time. Step 3: If at any point it becomes clear that annual liability will exceed ₹50,000, you move into the higher‑liability category subject to more frequent payments (typically monthly).

Example: If an employer with annual PTRC liability of ₹48,000 should have paid by 31 March but instead pays after 2 months, interest ≈ ₹48,000 × 1.25% × 2 = ₹1,200 and penalty = 10% × ₹48,000 = ₹4,800, for a total of ₹6,000 in additional charges besides the tax. Separately, failure to obtain PTRC on time also attracts a late‑registration penalty of ₹5 per day (Ebizfiling, Paytm, BankBazaar, ClearTax).

The employer does not generally pay an extra percentage of salary as a separate employer PT contribution for employees, but the employer may itself be liable to pay an enrolment PT under PTEC for its own business entity.",
        "employee": "For salaried and wage‑earning employees in PT‑levying states, professional tax is effectively an employee‑borne charge under PTRC. The employer deducts a fixed rupee amount per month from gross salary, according to the state slab (for example, in Andhra Pradesh, 0/150/200 per month depending on the salary bracket; in Maharashtra, no PT for female employees up to ₹25,000 per month, while male employees above ₹10,000 per month have a February deduction of ₹300 as per Simpliance’s partial slab). This deduction reduces the employee’s in‑hand pay. Employees who also carry on independent professional or business activities may incur a separate PT liability under PTEC in their own name.",
        "calculation": "Professional tax is not calculated as a percentage of salary but as a flat rupee amount determined by slabs. Generic calculation steps are: (1) Identify the state where the employee works (place of work usually determines which state’s PT applies). (2) For each wage/salary period (monthly in most states), determine the employee’s gross salary or wages for that period. (3) Look up the applicable slab in the state’s schedule. Example from Andhra Pradesh (official schedule): up to ₹15,000 per month – Nil; ₹15,001 to ₹20,000 – ₹150 per month; above ₹20,000 – ₹200 per month. Example from Maharashtra (partial Simpliance snippet): for male employees with wages above ₹10,000, ₹300 is deducted in February; for female employees up to ₹25,000 per month, PT is Nil; full slab must be checked for other bands and months. (4) Deduct the slab amount from the employee’s salary and add that amount to the total PT payable for the period. (5) Ensure that the total PT imposed on any individual from all PT‑levying jurisdictions together does not exceed ₹2,500 per financial year (constitutional cap). For self‑employed persons under PTEC, the state schedule specifies a fixed annual PT amount (often close to or at ₹2,500) that is paid by the individual directly.",
        "wageCeiling": "There is no single national wage ceiling limiting salaries subject to PT. Instead, the constitutional design imposes a ceiling on the annual tax amount: an individual’s total professional tax liability across all states/local authorities cannot exceed ₹2,500 per year (Simpliance, Zoho, ClearTax). Individual states set salary slabs and fixed rupee PT amounts such that no slab combination results in a person paying over ₹2,500 in a financial year."

        "registration": "Simpliance’s PT e‑library states that PT registration is mandatory within 30 days of employing staff in a business, and for professionals within 30 days from the start of the profession. This broadly reflects how PT registration/enrolment works across PT‑levying states. Two separate but related registrations usually exist: (1) PTEC – Professional Tax Enrolment Certificate, obtained by any person or entity liable to pay PT for its own business or profession (companies, LLPs, proprietors, partners, directors, self‑employed professionals, etc.); and (2) PTRC – Professional Tax Registration Certificate, obtained by employers who are responsible for deducting PT from employees’ salaries and remitting it. Required information generally includes PAN and registration details of the entity, legal constitution documents, address proof, bank details, list of branches/locations, employee headcount and salary structure, and authorised signatory details. Registration can usually be completed online on the state tax/professional tax portal; some states still allow or require physical submission for certain categories.",
        "renewal": "Professional tax enrolment (PTEC) and registration (PTRC) certificates are generally ongoing registrations that do not require periodic 'renewal' in the sense of re‑registration each year. Instead, compliance is maintained through timely payment of PT (monthly, quarterly, half‑yearly or annually, depending on the state and liability) and filing of any prescribed returns or challans. If there are significant changes (for example, change of address, change in nature of business, closure of establishment, or substantial change in employee strength in some states), amendments or cancellation applications may need to be filed with the PT authority. Annual PTEC payments (such as in Maharashtra and Karnataka) should not be confused with renewal of the certificate; they are payment obligations under an already‑existing enrolment.",
        "filingMethod": "Most PT‑levying states now support online enrollment, return filing and e‑payment through their official tax or commercial taxes portals. Examples visible or implied in the snippets include: Andhra Pradesh’s official tgct.gov.in portal, West Bengal’s Silpasathi portal for PT schedules and related services, and state tax portals in Maharashtra and Karnataka (names not given in snippets but commonly in use). Payment is usually made by generating a PT challan on the state portal and paying via internet banking, NEFT/RTGS, or authorised bank branches. Some states also permit offline form submission and over‑the‑counter payments for small employers or in areas with limited connectivity. Third‑party platforms such as Simpliance, Zoho Payroll and others provide consolidated guidance, calculators, and sometimes integration with state systems for payroll deduction calculations, but actual statutory payments must go through state‑approved channels.",
        "prerequisites": "Typical prerequisites for PT compliance include: (1) a legally established entity or an identifiable individual professional, with PAN and any central registrations (for example, GST registration, MSME registration) as applicable; (2) a place of business or employment in a PT‑levying state, as PT liability is generally linked to the location where services are rendered; (3) for PTRC, employees earning above that state’s PT‑exemption threshold (for example, above ₹15,000 per month in Andhra Pradesh; above the relevant male/female thresholds in Maharashtra; per West Bengal slabs); (4) access to the relevant state PT portal for registration, returns and payment; and (5) the ability to maintain payroll records detailing employee identity, designation, monthly gross salary, days worked, and PT deducted. For claiming income‑tax deductions, employees and businesses also need records of PT challans and payment proofs, as professional tax paid is generally allowable as a deduction from salary income (for employees) or as a business expense (for self‑employed) under the Income Tax Act, which is cross‑referenced by the Income Tax Department’s AY 2025‑26 business/profession guidance.",
        "recentUpdates": "Key updates and contextual points visible in the snippets up to 2025 include: (1) State slab and due‑date refreshers: TaxGuru’s August 2024 article and Saral’s state‑wise slab compilation, as well as Zoho’s September 2025 PT rules article and ClearTax’s August 2025 updates, confirm that states such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra continue to apply PT with updated slabs and due dates for FY 2024‑25 and beyond. Andhra Pradesh’s official tgct.gov.in schedule shows current employee slabs of 0/150/200 per month. BankBazaar’s Maharashtra FY 2024‑25 article confirms enrolment‑linked PTEC due dates (30 June or one month from enrolment). (2) Maharashtra female employee exemption: Simpliance’s Maharashtra schedule shows that female employees earning up to ₹25,000 per month are now fully exempt from PT ('Upto 25000, ₹0.00, Nil for Female Employees'). This is a meaningful policy variation from earlier, lower thresholds and is important for salary structuring in FY 2024‑25 and later. (3) Maharashtra PTRC liability threshold: State‑wise due‑date summaries from Taxtmi and Ebizfiling reiterate that employers with annual professional tax liability under or equal to ₹50,000 in Maharashtra can pay annually by 31 March, whereas those with higher liability follow more frequent (monthly) remittances. (4) Karnataka penalty revision: Setindiabiz’s 11 January 2025 article notes that from 1 April 2023, the penalty for not paying professional tax in Karnataka was revised to 10% of the tax amount due. This increased penalty underscores the importance of meeting the 30 April PTEC and other PT due dates in Karnataka. (5) West Bengal slab adjustments: The Silpasathi PDF notes that with effect from 1 August 2016, a slab previously taxed at ₹90 per month was reduced to Nil, widening the exempt income band. Zoho’s 2025 article also confirms continuing quarterly deadlines (15 May, 16 August, 15 November, 15 February) and a 2% per month late‑payment penalty for West Bengal. (6) Maharashtra arrears settlement for PSUs: PRS India hosts the text of the Maharashtra Settlement of Arrears of Tax, Interest, Penalty or Late Fee (Payable by Public Sector Undertaking) Act, 2025. This Act creates a framework for public sector undertakings in Maharashtra to settle arrears of various state‑level taxes (which may include professional tax) by paying specified amounts in exchange for waiver or reduction of interest, penalty and late fee. PSUs with historic PT arrears should review this scheme and any implementing notifications. (7) Non‑levying states reaffirmed: Paisabazaar’s July 2025 PT overview explicitly confirms that Delhi and Haryana do not levy professional tax, which remains relevant for SMEs operating or hiring exclusively in those states. (8) Enhanced focus on compliance: 2023–2025 guidance from Protean, OpportuneHR, ClearTax, Zoho and others repeatedly emphasises that delayed or non‑payment of PT leads to interest and penalties, and in some states may affect the ability of professionals to obtain or renew practising certificates (for example, for lawyers, CAs, doctors subject to state‑bar or council requirements). HR/payroll systems are encouraged to automatically calculate state‑wise PT, monitor thresholds such as Maharashtra’s ₹50,000 annual liability boundary and Andhra Pradesh’s ₹15,000 exemption level, and align deduction and remittance dates with the most recent state notifications."

However, the Income Tax Department tutorial 'LATE FILING FEES AND PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO ...' and AngelOne’s news article on the Income-tax (No. 2) Bill, 2025 both note that with effect from Assessment Year 2025-26, no penalty under section 271H will be levied in case of delay in filing TDS/TCS statements (i.e., late filing per se is no longer penalised under 271H, though incorrect or false statements may still attract penalty, and 234E fee continues). (3) Interest under section 201(1A) – if Form 24Q reflects late deduction or late payment of TDS, interest at 1% per month (for delay in deduction) and 1.5% per month (for delay in payment) applies, as per the Income Tax Department’s tutorial on interest and RegisterKaro’s article (which specifically notes 1.5% monthly with no upper cap). This interest must be paid before filing or correcting the statement. (4) Additional consequences – persistent defaults can lead to notices, best‑judgment processing, possible disallowance of salary expense under section 40(a)(ia) in extreme cases, and difficulties for employees in claiming credit."

(3) Interest under section 201(1A) – as for all TDS, 1% per month for non‑deduction or delay in deduction and 1.5% per month for delay in remittance, with no upper monetary cap, as indicated in the Income Tax Department’s interest tutorial and RegisterKaro’s article. Interest is computed for every month or part of a month of default and must be paid before filing or rectifying returns.

Thus, from AY 2025-26, routine late filing of quarterly TDS/TCS statements will generally attract only section 234E late-filing fee (and interest for associated late deduction/payment), not a separate 271H penalty, though incorrect/false statements can still be penalised.

        "registration": "Any person (including SMEs, startups, MSMEs) required to deduct or collect TDS/TCS must obtain a Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number (TAN) under section 203A before initiating deductions. TAN is quoted on Challan ITNS 281 and all TDS/TCS statements (Forms 24Q, 26Q, 27Q, 27EQ). Exceptions: certain 'specified persons' under section 194S (VDA) enjoy a threshold of Rs 50,000 and are not required to obtain TAN, as noted in the RSM India snippet. Registration on the Income Tax e‑Filing portal and TRACES portal is required for e‑filing statements, downloading Form 16/16A, and viewing defaults. PAN is mandatory for the deductor; PAN of deductees is required to avoid higher TDS and matching issues.",
        "renewal": "TAN and PAN are permanent identifiers and do not require periodic renewal. However, TDS registration on the e‑Filing and TRACES portals may require re‑authentication (for example, re‑registration of digital signatures, password resets). SMEs must renew digital signature certificates (DSCs) periodically as per DSC validity but there is no separate TDS 'license' renewal.",
        "filingMethod": "TDS/TCS returns (Forms 24Q, 26Q, 27Q, 27EQ) must be filed electronically. Deductors typically: (1) use a Return Preparation Utility (RPU) and File Validation Utility (FVU) (from NSDL/Protean or other vendors) to prepare a text file in the prescribed schema; (2) log in to the Income Tax e‑Filing portal (https://www.incometax.gov.in/) using TAN credentials; (3) upload the validated FVU file under TDS/TCS section; and (4) verify using Digital Signature Certificate (DSC), Electronic Verification Code (EVC) or as prescribed. Earlier, filing could also be done at TIN‑FCs but the standard mode is now online. Payment of TDS/TCS via Challan ITNS 281 is made either: (a) through authorised bank branches (physical challan with cheque/cash) or (b) via net banking or NEFT/RTGS through the OLTAS/e‑payment facility, selecting Challan 281 and providing TAN, AY, and section codes. TRACES portal is used post‑filing to download Consolidated Files, Justification Reports, and Form 16/16A and to respond to TDS defaults.",
        "prerequisites": "Key prerequisites for TDS compliance by SMEs/MSMEs include: (1) Valid TAN and PAN of the deductor; (2) PAN (or Aadhaar, where permitted) of all deductees to avoid higher TDS rates and credit mismatches; (3) Accounting systems capable of tracking section‑wise taxable payments, thresholds, and due dates; (4) Knowledge of applicable TDS sections and rates using current FY rate charts (such as those published by ClearTax, TDSMAN, IndiaFilings, Kotak Life, PNB MetLife, RSM etc.); (5) Access to e‑Filing and TRACES portals; (6) Digital Signature Certificate where required; (7) Mechanism to compute interest under section 201(1A) and late fees under section 234E when there is any delay; and (8) Robust vendor and employee onboarding processes to capture PAN, residency status, and treaty details (for non‑residents).",
        "recentUpdates": "Key updates and 2025‑specific points drawn from the search results are: (1) Relaxation of multiple TDS thresholds from FY 2025-26 – ClearTax’s FY 2025-26 TDS rate chart notes that 'TDS threshold limits has been relaxed for many important sections with effect from this year' and that 'TDS rates have remained mostly unchanged', implying that many SMEs may fall below TDS applicability for certain small-value payments; users should consult the full section‑wise table for exact revised limits. (2) Increased threshold for senior citizens' bank interest – Kotak Life’s FY 2025-26 rate chart highlights that 'the main changes from April 2025 involve increased threshold limits'. Specifically, it mentions that 'the TDS limit for interest paid by banks to senior citizens is ...', indicating that the Rs 50,000 exemption limit under section 194A for senior citizens has been increased from 1 April 2025, though the snippet does not show the exact new amount. (3) Higher threshold for payments to co‑operative societies – IndiaFilings’ FY 2025-26 rate chart snippet states that 'the TDS limit, in case if the recipient is co-operative society, will be INR 3 Crores instead of INR 1 Crore', signifying a tripling of the exemption limit for a specific TDS provision involving co‑operative society recipients (section reference not shown in snippet). (4) Introduction of section 194T – PNB MetLife’s FY 2024-25 TDS chart notes that 'Section 194T introduces 10% TDS on firm-to-partner payments exceeding Rs.20,000', creating a new TDS obligation on certain firm‑to‑partner payments beyond Rs 20,000 in a financial year. (5) Continued operation of section 206AB (higher TDS for specified non-filers) – PNB MetLife’s chart notes that 'Higher TDS for non-filers under 206AB ensures tax compliance', reminding SMEs that certain payees who have not filed returns in previous years and meet the 'specified person' definition can attract higher TDS rates (typically higher of twice the rate specified, twice the rate in force, or 5%), although exact formula details are not in the snippets. (6) Rate changes mid‑year for FY 2024-25 – Setindiabiz’s 'Updated TDS Rates & Thresholds for FY 2024-25' specifies that 'Rates change mid-year on Oct 1, 2024', meaning that for some sections, there are distinct rates for 1 April–30 September 2024 and 1 October 2024–31 March 2025; SMEs must check which half‑year rate applies to a given payment date. (7) Removal of section 271H penalty for mere late filing from AY 2025-26 – The Income Tax Department’s late-filing/penalty tutorial (30 September 2025) states that 'with effect from Assessment Year 2025-26, no penalty under section 271H will be levied in case of delay in filing the TDS/TCS ...'. AngelOne’s article on the Income Tax (No. 2) Bill, 2025 echoes that 'under the new provisions, there will be no financial penalty if a taxpayer files their TDS returns late', meaning that from AY 2025-26 onward, routine late filing is subject to section 234E fees but not 271H penalty, although incorrect statements may still face penal consequences. (8) Confirmation of section 234E regime – Multiple 2025 guidance articles (ClearTax’s section 234E piece, Bajaj Finserv’s 234E article, Kotak Life’s penalty article, RegisterKaro’s note, and Figment Global’s example) reaffirm that late filing of TDS/TCS statements triggers a fee of Rs 200 per day, capped at the TDS/TCS amount, and that this fee is separate from interest under section 201(1A). (9) Emphasis on monthly 7th‑day deposit and extended March deadline – ClearTax, SAG Infotech, Jainam and Bajaj Finserv confirm that the 'due date for depositing TDS amount is usually the 7th of the next month', with an extended deadline for March (statutorily 30 April) highlighted as a specific exception in Bajaj Finserv’s FY 2025-26 article. (10) Advanced due dates for FY 2025-26 non‑salary TDS returns – Kotak Life’s 'TDS Return Due Dates of FY 2025-26' snippet explicitly changes the Q1 and Q2 due dates for Forms 26Q and 27Q to 15 July and 15 October respectively, while Form 24Q remains 31 July; SMEs must update compliance calendars accordingly. (11) MSME/Startup focus – Ricago’s 2025 blog on TDS/TCS compliances for Startups and MSMEs underscores that each TDS/TCS section has specific rates, thresholds and compliance requirements, and that 2025 changes (such as higher thresholds and removal of some penalties) are particularly relevant to smaller entities looking to simplify compliance. SMEs should systematically map their payment types to sections, apply the correct FY 2024-25 or 2025-26 rate chart, and monitor ongoing Finance Act changes."

This return reports delayed payments to MSME suppliers. Professional sources such as ClearTax, TaxGuru, LegalWiz, Bajaj Finserv, CAMF Khan, SAG Infotech, Tally Solutions and StartupFlora all describe Form MSME-1 as a mandatory half-yearly ROC filing for such specified companies when payments to MSME suppliers remain unpaid beyond 45 days. (2) Udyam Registration Annual Update: Every enterprise that has obtained MSME (Udyam) registration on the official Udyam Registration portal of the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (udyamregistration.gov.in) is required to keep its registration data updated online on that portal, including turnover and investment data sourced from its Income Tax Return (ITR) and GST returns. Professional commentary (e.g., StartupFlora and IndiaFilings) refers to this as an 'MSME Udyam Annual Update' and explains that the Ministry uses ITR and GSTN data from relevant financial years (for example, IndiaFilings notes that for 2022–2023 classification, data from 2020–2021 were used), so MSMEs should update their Udyam details at least annually once their tax data are finalised.",

          "description": "Form MSME-1 (commonly referred to as MSME Form 1) is a half-yearly e-form prescribed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) to be filed with the Registrar of Companies (ROC) under Section 405 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Specified Companies (Furnishing of information about payment to micro and small enterprise suppliers) Order, 2019. It must be filed by 'specified companies' that obtain goods or services from suppliers classified as Micro or Small Enterprises (MSEs) under the MSMED Act, 2006 and that have payments to such suppliers remaining unpaid for more than 45 days from the date of acceptance or deemed acceptance. The form reports details of outstanding amounts and delays so that the government can monitor whether companies are honouring the MSMED Act’s mandate for timely payment to small suppliers. The latest V3 version of the form on the MCA V3 portal, discussed in 2025 articles such as TaxGuru’s 'New MSME-1 (V3) Era: Don’t Miss These Hidden Compliance Triggers' and Tally Solutions’ 'MSME Form 1 Reporting Changes – Key Updates for 2025', has enhanced data fields. It requires: (a) company information (CIN/FCRN, name, registered office address, email ID, PAN), (b) the return type and reporting half-year (April–September or October–March), and (c) supplier-wise information for each Micro or Small Enterprise to whom payments have been delayed beyond 45 days, including supplier name, Udyam Registration Number or other MSME registration details, amount due, date from which the amount has been outstanding, and reasons for the delay, as well as disclosure related to interest under the MSMED Act. Its policy objective, highlighted across multiple guides (ClearTax, LegalWiz, Bajaj Finserv, CAMF Khan, SAG Infotech and TaxGuru), is to enforce payment discipline towards MSMEs and to provide transparency of chronic payment delays.",

            "calculation": "Step 1: Identify all suppliers that qualify as Micro or Small Enterprises under the MSMED Act and that have valid MSME/Udyam registration (many guides advise obtaining a copy of the Udyam certificate or URN). Step 2: For each such MSME supplier, list all invoices or dues where payment is still outstanding. Step 3: For each invoice, determine the 'date of acceptance' or 'deemed acceptance' of the goods or services as per the MSMED Act. Step 4: Calculate the 45th day from this acceptance date. If the invoice remains unpaid after this 45-day point, it becomes reportable in MSME-1. Step 5: Allocate each delayed invoice to the appropriate half-year based on when the delay beyond 45 days occurs and whether it remains outstanding at the end of that half-year. Example A (April–September period): An invoice from a micro enterprise supplier is dated and accepted on 1 May 2025. The 45-day limit expires on 15 June 2025. If the payment is still outstanding on and after 16 June 2025 and remains unpaid at 30 September 2025, the invoice is reportable in MSME-1 for the half-year 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025, which must be filed by 31 October 2025. Example B (October–March period): An invoice is accepted on 10 January 2026. The 45-day limit expires on 24 February 2026. If it is unpaid beyond 24 February 2026 and remains unpaid at 31 March 2026, it must be reported in the MSME-1 for the half-year 1 October 2025 to 31 March 2026, due by 30 April 2026.",

          },
          "penalty": "There is no government filing fee for submitting Form MSME-1; CAMF Khan’s 2025 article explicitly states 'Filing Fees: There is no fee for filing Form MSME-1.' However, non-compliance with MSME-1 requirements attracts penalties under Section 405(4) of the Companies Act, 2013, as synthesised from multiple 2024–25 professional sources (ClearTax, SAG Infotech, RegistrationWala, CompanySuggestion, TaxGuru, CAMF Khan, StartupFlora and TaxScan): (1) Trigger for penalty: failure to file MSME-1 within the prescribed time, furnishing incomplete or incorrect information, or non-compliance with an order requiring information/statistics under Section 405. (2) Base (one-time) penalty: ClearTax’s April 2025 MSME-1 guide and RegistrationWala’s June 2025 MSME-1 article state that if a company fails to file MSME-1, the company and every officer in default will be liable to a penalty of about ₹20,000 each. CAMF Khan’s May 2025 write-up refers to this as a fine 'up to ₹25,000' on the company, reflecting the statutory wording that the penalty may extend to ₹25,000. StartupFlora’s 2025 due date article summarises that penalties for MSME return non-compliance can range from ₹25,000 to ₹1,00,000, depending on circumstances, which is within the broader statutory range used in practice. (3) Per-day penalty for continuing default: SAG Infotech’s 2025 guide (quoting Section 405(4)) and RegistrationWala’s June 2025 article state that in case of continuing failure there is a further fine of ₹1,000 for every day during which the default continues. CompanySuggestion’s July 2024 article on adjudicating penalty for delayed MSME filing also notes an 'additional penalty of ₹1,000 for every day during which the failure continues.' (4) Maximum penalty cap: TaxScan’s April 2025 news item reports that companies may face penalty 'up to ₹3 lakh' for not filing MSME-1, and CompanySuggestion mentions that the per-day penalty is 'subject to a maximum', which aligns with the adjudication framework where total penalty on each defaulter is typically capped at ₹3,00,000. Accordingly, a widely used working model in 2025 professional practice is: Company – base penalty of about ₹20,000 plus ₹1,000 per day of continuing default, capped at a total of ₹3,00,000; Officers in default – similar daily penalty structure, again capped at ₹3,00,000 per officer. (5) Filing fee vs. penalty: there is no ROC filing fee for timely MSME-1; the amounts described above are penalties imposed through adjudication if the company defaults. (6) Interest: no interest rate is prescribed on the MSME-1 filing itself. Separately, under the MSMED Act, if a buyer delays payment to a registered micro or small enterprise beyond the agreed date or 45 days, the buyer is liable to pay compound interest with monthly rests at three times the Reserve Bank of India’s bank rate to the supplier. This interest obligation is independent of MSME-1 but is closely related, as MSME-1 disclosure highlights the delayed payments on which such interest may accrue. (7) Practical application: the exact penalty imposed in any case depends on ROC adjudication, taking into account length of delay, number of invoices/suppliers affected, prior defaults, and whether there was wilful concealment or only technical breach."

          "name": "Udyam Annual Update – Online Update of MSME (Udyam) Registration Details",
          "description": "The Udyam Annual Update is not a numbered statutory form but an online updating process for enterprises that have already obtained MSME registration (Udyam Registration Number) through the official Udyam Registration portal of the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (udyamregistration.gov.in). The process is commonly referred to in professional guides such as StartupFlora’s 'MSME Return Due Date – Complete Guide for 2025' as the 'MSME Udyam Annual Update'. It involves logging into the Udyam portal and updating enterprise data, including address, contact details, bank details, number of employees, and, critically, financial data on investment in plant and machinery or equipment and turnover. IndiaFilings’ article 'MSME Clarification on Selection of Financial Year for Udyam Registration' explains that for determining MSME classification the Ministry fetches data from the Income Tax and GSTN systems for a relevant financial year (for example, for classification applicable in 2022–2023, data from 2020–2021 were used), underscoring that the Udyam portal relies on tax-return data and expects enterprises to keep their Udyam profiles aligned with filed ITRs and GST returns. The core purpose of the Udyam Annual Update is therefore to keep MSME classification (Micro/Small/Medium) and other enterprise information current so that benefits, protections (including MSMED Act delayed payment protections) and various verification processes (such as buyers checking MSME status before reporting in MSME-1) are based on accurate data.",

Professional sources in the search results describe this as an 'annual update', but they do not specify an exact statutory calendar due date such as '31 March' or '31 December'. Rather, the expectation is that each enterprise should log into the Udyam portal at least once every financial year, after its ITR and GST data for the previous year are available, and update its investment and turnover figures and any other details requested by the portal. The Ministry then uses those updated values, together with data obtained from the Income Tax and GSTN back-end systems (as highlighted by IndiaFilings’ clarification article), to confirm or revise the enterprise’s classification as Micro, Small or Medium. The specific timing windows, if any, are operationally controlled by the portal and may be communicated through portal messages rather than fixed in the text of the notification.",

Step 3: Log into the official Udyam Registration portal (udyamregistration.gov.in) using the enterprise’s Udyam Registration Number and the registered mobile number or Aadhaar-based OTP authentication. Step 4: Enter or confirm updated details in the portal’s update interface – including turnover, investment, employment, contact information and any other fields requested – ensuring that the figures match those in the filed ITR and GST returns. Step 5: Submit the update and download or save any revised Udyam certificate or acknowledgment generated by the portal. Because the Ministry may rely on prior-year tax data (for example, IndiaFilings notes that FY 2020–21 data were used for 2022–23 classification), enterprises should follow any specific instructions or timelines indicated on the Udyam portal for when to perform the update.",

Instead, the consequences of not updating are regulatory and practical rather than fee-based: (1) Suspension or deactivation of MSME status: the Udyam notification empowers the Ministry to suspend or deactivate an enterprise’s MSME registration if it fails to update its information within the period specified on the portal. During suspension, the enterprise may not be treated as an active MSME for purposes of schemes or verification. (2) Loss or blocking of benefits: if data are outdated, the enterprise may face difficulty in availing MSME-specific benefits, subsidies, or priority in government tenders and schemes until it regularises its Udyam record. (3) Misclassification risk: if turnover or investment has increased or decreased significantly but has not been updated, the portal may show an incorrect classification (e.g., still Micro when it should be Small), which can create issues when buyers, banks or government departments verify MSME status, and may also complicate enforcement of MSMED Act payment protections. (4) No statutory interest rate or per-day monetary penalty is specified in the search results for late updating itself. The key compliance risk is therefore loss or suspension of MSME recognition rather than an explicit rupee-denominated late fee."

The article states that 'the penalty for not filing a companies annual return (Form MGT-7 and Form AOC-4) would be increased to Rs.200 per day from 1st July 2018.' In practical terms, this corresponds to additional filing fees of approximately ₹100 per day for each delayed form, i.e., ₹100 per day for AOC-4 and, if both AOC-4 and MGT-7 are delayed, a combined effect of ₹200 per day until filing. These per-day additional fees accumulate from the day after the statutory due date up to the actual date of filing. Beyond additional fees, the Companies Act also provides for separate penalties on the company and its officers in default for failure to file AOC-4 within time, which can include fixed penalties plus per-day components, but the detailed slab amounts are not set out in the search results. No interest rate is prescribed; the financial burden is a linear function of the number of days of delay multiplied by the per-day additional fee, plus any adjudicated penalties if imposed."

The annual return captures information such as shareholding pattern, debenture holdings, details of directors and key managerial personnel, meetings of members and board, and other statutory disclosures.

The article states that 'the penalty for not filing a companies annual return (Form MGT-7 and Form AOC-4) would be increased to Rs.200 per day from 1st July 2018.' This is generally interpreted in practice as an additional fee of ₹100 per day for each delayed form, i.e., ₹100 per day for MGT-7 and, if both AOC-4 and MGT-7 are delayed, a combined additional fee impact of around ₹200 per day until both are filed. These fees accrue from the day after the statutory due date until the filing date. In addition, the Companies Act prescribes separate penalties for non-filing or delayed filing of MGT-7, imposed on the company and on officers in default through adjudication, but the detailed numerical slabs for those penalties are not described in the search results and so are not restated here. No specific interest rate applies; the cost of delay scales with the number of days of default and the per-day additional fees, plus any adjudicated penalties."

        "registration": "For MSME-1: There is no separate registration process for Form MSME-1. Any company that is already incorporated and has a Corporate Identity Number (CIN) or Foreign Company Registration Number (FCRN) on the MCA portal can file MSME-1 using its existing credentials. The company must maintain an up-to-date master data profile on the MCA portal (registered email, authorised signatories, and Digital Signature Certificates) since the MSME-1 e-form is filed electronically. For MSMEs (suppliers): To be treated as an MSME for payment protection and MSME-1 reporting, a supplier must be registered under the MSMED Act, which is now implemented through Udyam Registration on the official portal udyamregistration.gov.in. Multiple guidance sources (ClearTax’s MSME registration article, Filingg’s 2025 Udyam registration guide, and msme-form.org) describe the registration process: it is online, generally free on the government portal, and requires Aadhaar of the proprietor/partner/director, PAN, and key business details. Registration is not mandatory to run a business, but is essential for being recognised as an MSME and for buyers to be obligated to report delayed payments in MSME-1. For Udyam Annual Update: Only enterprises that have already obtained an Udyam Registration Number can perform the annual update. Login typically uses the Udyam Registration Number along with OTP sent to the registered mobile number and/or Aadhaar authentication.",
        "renewal": "MSME-1 itself does not involve any renewal; it is a periodic half-yearly return. Companies simply continue to file it for each relevant half-year in which there are reportable delays to MSE suppliers. Udyam registration under the current framework is generally treated as valid for the lifetime of the enterprise, subject to the requirement that information (especially financial data) be periodically updated. There is no separate time-bound 'renewal' of Udyam registration in the sense of reapplying for a new registration number, but the annual update of information serves a similar function in keeping the registration active and accurate. Failure to update can lead to suspension or deactivation until the data are brought up to date.",
        "filingMethod": "Form MSME-1 is filed electronically on the MCA V3 portal. The latest V3 version of MSME-1, discussed in TaxGuru’s 2025 'MSME-1 V3 Era' article and Tally Solutions’ 2025 update note, is an online e-form that captures company and supplier-wise data. The form is prepared and submitted online by an authorised signatory of the company using a valid Digital Signature Certificate (DSC), and may require certification by a practising professional (CA/CS/CMA) depending on MCA requirements at the time of filing. There is no government filing fee. Udyam Annual Update is completed entirely online on the official Udyam Registration portal (udyamregistration.gov.in). The enterprise logs in using its Udyam Registration Number and receives OTPs on the registered mobile number; details are updated on-screen and submitted digitally. No physical filings are involved. Forms AOC-4 and MGT-7/MGT-7A are also filed online on the MCA portal using DSCs, with payment of normal filing fees plus any applicable additional fees for late filing. Professional guidance (e.g., TMWala and IndiaFilings) emphasises that for MSMEs operating as companies, these ROC e-filings are as important as sector-specific returns like MSME-1.",
        "prerequisites": "For MSME-1: (1) Identification of MSME suppliers – the company must identify which of its suppliers qualify as Micro or Small Enterprises under the MSMED Act. Guidance such as StartupFlora’s 2025 MSME return article recommends obtaining a copy of each supplier’s Udyam Registration Certificate or at least the Udyam Registration Number as evidence of MSME status. (2) Ageing analysis of payables – the company should maintain detailed accounts payable records showing invoice dates, acceptance/deemed acceptance dates and payment dates in order to determine which payments have exceeded the 45-day limit. (3) Internal controls – companies are expected to set up internal systems and cut-off procedures to capture all outstanding dues to MSEs as at 30 September and 31 March each year. (4) Updated MCA credentials – authorised signatories must possess valid DSCs and be registered users on the MCA V3 portal. For Udyam Annual Update: (1) Availability of the latest filed Income Tax Return and GST returns so that turnover and investment figures can be updated accurately; (2) correct Udyam Registration Number and access to the registered mobile number or Aadhaar-linked OTP for login; (3) clarity on current business status (e.g., any change in address, partners or directors) so that the portal profile can be updated in full. For AOC-4 and MGT-7: prerequisites include audited financial statements, board and shareholder approvals where required, and a clear record of shareholding and governance details; these are generic company law prerequisites rather than MSME-specific.",
        "recentUpdates": "Several 2024–25 materials in the search results highlight recent developments relevant to MSME annual/periodic returns: (1) Enhanced MSME-1 format and MCA V3 migration (2025): TaxGuru’s October 2025 article on 'Form MSME-1: Filing, Due Dates, Applicability, Penalty & Payment Compliance', its October 2025 'MSME-1 V3 Era' article, and Tally Solutions’ June 2025 note on 'MSME Form 1 Reporting Changes' describe how MSME-1 has been upgraded on the MCA V3 portal. The new MSME-1 (V3) form requires more detailed information than earlier iterations, including comprehensive company details (CIN/FCRN, name, registered office address, email ID, PAN), explicit selection of the reporting half-year, and granular supplier-wise data (identification of each Micro or Small Enterprise supplier, Udyam Registration details, amount outstanding, exact date from which dues have been pending, and reasons for delay, together with flags relating to interest under the MSMED Act). These enhancements are aimed at strengthening oversight of delayed payments to MSMEs and enabling more robust analytics by regulators. (2) Continued emphasis on half-yearly due dates: Multiple 2025 articles (StartupFlora, SAG Infotech, LegalWiz, Bajaj Finserv, ClearTax, TaxGuru) reiterate and re-educate companies about the 31 October and 30 April due dates for MSME-1, indicating that regulators and practitioners consider delayed payment reporting a high-priority compliance area for 2025. (3) Clarifications on MSME financial data used for classification: The IndiaFilings article on 'MSME Clarification on Selection of Financial Year for Udyam Registration' explains that for determining MSME classification on the Udyam portal, the Ministry uses data from Income Tax and GSTN systems for a relevant financial year (for example, FY 2020–21 data for classification in 2022–23). This underscores that MSME classification is data-driven and somewhat lagged, and highlights the importance of accurate tax filings and periodic updates of Udyam details. (4) MSME sector profile and Udyam portal background: The official 'MSME Annual Report 2024-25' of the Ministry of MSME notes that the Udyam Registration portal was launched on 1 July 2020, replacing the earlier Udyog Aadhaar system, and it discusses the revised classification criteria based on both investment and turnover. The report also highlights the MSME sector’s contribution to India’s GDP and exports, reinforcing the policy focus on timely payments and data transparency, which in turn drives enforcement of MSME-1 and the need for up-to-date Udyam records. (5) Stronger enforcement narrative for MSME-1 penalties: News and guidance pieces such as TaxScan’s April 2025 article and CompanySuggestion’s July 2024 discussion of adjudication orders emphasise that companies can face significant penalties – including daily penalties and caps up to ₹3 lakh per defaulter – for non-filing of MSME-1, indicating that ROC adjudication in relation to MSME-1 is an active area in 2024–25. (6) Ongoing emphasis on general annual returns for MSME companies: TMWala’s 2025 compliance checklist and the IndiaFilings penalty article highlight that MSME companies must not only comply with MSME-1 and Udyam requirements but also remain current on general ROC forms AOC-4 and MGT-7/MGT-7A, where the effective additional fee for delayed filing (₹100 per form per day, described in IndiaFilings as ₹200 per day when both AOC-4 and MGT-7 are overdue) continues to apply in 2025."

This particular instance of the form covers the half-year reporting period from 1 October to 31 March (October–March). In the current revised regime (as reflected in 2024–2025 articles and the 2025 notification), the form must capture: (a) all dues to MSE suppliers that are outstanding for more than 45 days as of 31 March, and (b) all invoices to MSE suppliers where, at any time during the October–March period, the payment actually took more than 45 days from the date of acceptance/deemed acceptance, even if the dues were fully paid by 31 March. The form is not filed by the MSME itself; it is filed by the buying company (the debtor) and includes supplier-wise details such as the name of the MSE supplier, its PAN, amount due or delayed, the date from which it became due, and the reason for the delay. The e-form is filed through the MCA21 V3 portal and must be digitally signed by an authorised signatory (Director, CFO or Company Secretary).",

            "formula": "For the October–March half-year, Form MSME-1 must be filed on or before 30 April immediately following the end of that half-year. Thus, for the period 1 October 2024 to 31 March 2025, the due date is 30 April 2025; for 1 October 2025 to 31 March 2026, the due date is 30 April 2026, and so on.",
            "calculation": "Step 1: Identify all transactions with registered Micro and Small Enterprise (MSE) suppliers for the six‑month period from 1 October to 31 March.\nStep 2: For each invoice, determine the \"date of acceptance\" or \"deemed acceptance\" as per the MSMED Act, 2006 (typically, the date when the buyer accepts delivery or, if objections are not raised within 15 days, the date of delivery becomes deemed acceptance).\nStep 3: Compute the number of days between the date of acceptance/deemed acceptance and the date of actual payment (or the 31 March cut‑off date if still unpaid). If this exceeds 45 days at any point, flag the invoice as a \"delayed payment\". Also separately identify invoices that remain unpaid beyond 45 days as of 31 March.\nStep 4: Aggregate all such delayed payments to MSE suppliers and prepare supplier‑wise details: supplier name, PAN, amount due or delayed, the date from which the amount became due, and reasons for delay.\nStep 5: Log in to the MCA21 V3 portal, select the Form MSME‑1 for the relevant October–March half‑year, enter company identification details (CIN/FCRN, name, registered office address, email ID, PAN, etc.) and reporting period details, and fill in the supplier‑wise delayed payment information.\nStep 6: Get the form digitally signed by an authorised signatory (Director, CFO or Company Secretary with a valid Digital Signature Certificate), perform pre‑scrutiny/validation, and upload the e‑form. Filing must be completed by 30 April following the 31 March cut‑off date.",
            "gracePeriod": "There is no statutory grace period prescribed in the Order or the Companies Act for Form MSME-1. Even a one‑day delay beyond 30 April may technically attract penalty under Section 405(4). In practice, any relaxation of the deadline, if granted, is done by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) through specific General Circulars or notifications for a particular year or event (for example, during extraordinary disruptions), and such relaxations are not automatic.",
            "extensions": "Guidance articles for FY 2025–26 report that the government/MCA has confirmed the MSME Form 1 due dates on the official MCA website for that year, continuing the pattern of 30 April (for October–March) and 31 October (for April–September). As per the snippets available, no permanent statutory extension has been introduced up to late 2025. Any year‑specific extensions, if notified by MCA, must be checked in the latest MCA General Circulars and notifications; they are not embedded in the core legal provision governing MSME‑1."
          },
          "penalty": "Penalties arise under two different laws: (1) the Companies Act, 2013 for non‑filing/incorrect filing of Form MSME‑1, and (2) the MSMED Act, 2006 for delayed payment to MSE suppliers itself.\n\nA. Penalty under the Companies Act, 2013 (Section 405(4)) for MSME‑1 non‑compliance:\n• Trigger: Failure to file the return in Form MSME‑1 by the due date, or furnishing information or statistics that are incorrect or incomplete in any material respect.\n• Who is liable: The company as a legal entity, and every officer of the company who is in default.\n• Base penalty: Commentaries summarising the current (post‑decriminalisation) Section 405(4) provision state that the company and each officer in default are liable to a fixed penalty of ₹20,000 for such failure.\n• Per‑day penalty: Additional penalty of ₹1,000 per day for the period during which the default continues beyond the first day of default (i.e., from the day after the due date until the date of actual filing/rectification), as reported by professional platforms (e.g., one source explicitly mentions \"penalty of Rs. 20,000\" with an additional \"fine of Rs. 1,000 per day of default\").\n• Maximum penalty (cap): At least one reported source notes that companies may face penalties \"up to ₹3 lakh\" for not filing MSME‑1; this aligns with the common cap structure in the Companies Act after the 2020 amendments, where total penalty for the company for a continuing default is generally capped at ₹3,00,000. Some earlier/alternate commentaries (including those quoting the pre‑amendment text) refer to a fine structure of up to ₹25,000 for the company and a range of ₹25,000 to ₹3,00,000 for every officer in default, or quote penalty ranges (e.g., ₹25,000 to ₹1,00,000). Because of these varying secondary sources, the exact officer‑level cap (e.g., ₹1,00,000 vs ₹3,00,000) should be confirmed from the latest bare text of Section 405(4) and any subsequent MCA amendments.\n• Calculation method (company perspective, based on the common post‑amendment reading):\n  – Step 1: Identify the number of days of continuous default: from the day after the statutory due date (e.g., 1 May for the October–March period) up to and including the actual date of filing or the date on which the ROC takes cognisance of non‑filing.\n  – Step 2: Start with a fixed penalty of ₹20,000.\n  – Step 3: Add ₹1,000 for each day of continuing default after the first day (i.e., number of days in Step 1).\n  – Step 4: If the sum of the fixed penalty and daily penalties exceeds the statutory cap (commonly cited as ₹3,00,000 for the company), restrict the company’s total penalty to that cap.\n  – Step 5: A similar computation is applied to each officer in default, subject to the individual caps applicable to officers (variously cited in commentaries as between ₹1,00,000 and ₹3,00,000). The adjudicating officer under the Companies Act has discretion within these bounds.\n• Important nuances: (a) Penalty is adjudicated and imposed by the designated adjudicating officer; it is not an automatic “late fee” that is paid at the time of form upload. (b) Separate penalties may apply for each half‑year of default, since MSME‑1 is a half‑yearly return.\n\nB. Financial consequence under MSMED Act, 2006 for delayed payments (independent of MSME‑1 filing):\n• Trigger: Failure by a buyer (including companies) to make payment to a registered Micro or Small Enterprise supplier within the period agreed in writing (which cannot exceed 45 days from the date of acceptance or deemed acceptance), or, where no written agreement exists, within 15 days from the date of acceptance/deemed acceptance.\n• Interest rate: The buyer is liable to pay compound interest with monthly rests at three times the bank rate notified by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This is a statutory obligation under Section 16 of the MSMED Act and cannot be contracted out of.\n• Interest calculation method:\n  – Step 1: Determine the \"appointed day\" as per MSMED Act (typically the day following the expiry of the maximum permitted credit period under Section 15, which in any case may not exceed 45 days from date of acceptance/deemed acceptance).\n  – Step 2: Calculate the outstanding principal owed to the MSE supplier on each day of delay beyond the appointed day.\n  – Step 3: Apply interest at 3 × RBI bank rate, with monthly compounding, on the outstanding principal from the appointed day until the date of actual payment.\n• Enforcement: The MSE supplier may file a reference to the Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council (MSEFC) via the MSME SAMADHAAN portal. As per the SAMADHAAN system description, every reference to MSEFC is to be decided within 90 days. Proceedings before MSEFC can result in enforceable orders for payment of principal plus statutory interest.\n• Interaction with MSME‑1: Filing or non‑filing of MSME‑1 does not affect the supplier’s substantive right to interest under the MSMED Act. MSME‑1 is a disclosure/compliance requirement under the Companies Act; the interest obligation and potential MSEFC proceedings arise independently under the MSMED Act.\n\nIn practice, companies should treat MSME‑1 non‑filing risk as a layered consequence: (1) regulatory penalty under Section 405(4) (fixed plus per‑day penalty, subject to caps) and (2) commercial and legal exposure to MSEFC proceedings and statutory interest at three times the RBI bank rate for the underlying delayed payments."

The form is identical in structure to the October–March return; the reporting period is selected using the \"Return / Reporting Period\" or similar field in the MCA V3 e‑form interface. For the April–September half‑year, the company must disclose: (a) all amounts payable to registered Micro and Small Enterprise suppliers that remain outstanding for more than 45 days as of 30 September, and (b) all invoices where payment during that April–September period took more than 45 days from the date of acceptance/deemed acceptance, even if no amount is outstanding as on 30 September. Guidance sources emphasise that the filing obligation is triggered even if there is just a single delayed payment during the half‑year. The e‑form requires company details (CIN/FCRN, name, registered office address, email, PAN, etc.), selection of half‑year, and supplier‑wise information (name of MSE supplier, PAN, amount due/delayed, date from which it became due, and reason for delay), and it must be digitally signed by a Director, CFO or Company Secretary.",

          "penalty": "The penalty framework for the April–September MSME‑1 is identical to that for the October–March MSME‑1, because both are governed by Section 405(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and the same MSMED Act provisions on delayed payment. In summary:\n\nA. Under the Companies Act, 2013 (Section 405(4)):\n• Failure to file the April–September MSME‑1 by 31 October, or furnishing incorrect/incomplete information, exposes the company and every officer in default to a base penalty commonly summarised as ₹20,000, plus an additional ₹1,000 per day of continuing default after the due date, up to an overall cap (reported in guidance as up to ₹3,00,000 for the company). Older commentaries still quote a fine structure of up to ₹25,000 for the company and ₹25,000–₹3,00,000 (or up to ₹1,00,000) for officers. Users should confirm the exact current figures in the latest bare text of Section 405(4).\n• Penalties are imposed via adjudication (they do not function as an automatic late fee on the MCA portal). Separate defaults for each half‑year may attract separate penalties.\n\nB. Under the MSMED Act, 2006:\n• The underlying delayed payments to MSE suppliers for the April–September period trigger statutory interest at three times the RBI bank rate, compounded monthly, from the appointed day until payment. Suppliers can invoke the MSME SAMADHAAN system and MSEFC for adjudication, which, as per official descriptions, is to be decided within 90 days of reference.\n\nThe practical computation steps and risk profile (base penalty, per‑day penalty, interest at 3× RBI bank rate) are the same as described for the October–March MSME‑1 return."

        "registration": "There is no separate registration process to become liable for or to use Form MSME-1. Any company registered under the Companies Act, 2013 (or earlier Companies Acts) that meets the specified conditions is automatically a \"specified company\" for this purpose. However, to determine whether MSME-1 is applicable, companies must identify which of their suppliers are registered as Micro or Small Enterprises under the MSMED Act. In practice, this means obtaining and maintaining evidence of the supplier’s Udyam Registration (Udyam Registration Certificate or Udyam Registration Number) and ensuring that the supplier is actually classified as Micro or Small (Medium enterprises do not qualify for MSME-1 reporting). The company must also be registered on the MCA21 V3 portal with an active login and maintain valid Digital Signature Certificates (DSCs) for authorised signatories (Directors, CFO, Company Secretary) to file the e-form.",
        "renewal": "There is no concept of renewal for Form MSME-1 itself; it is a recurring half-yearly return and must be filed separately for each half-year in which the trigger conditions are met. Suppliers’ Udyam registrations may require periodic verification/updates separately under MSME rules (e.g., annual update obligations for Udyam), but those are separate MSME-side compliances and do not replace or remove the buyer-company’s duty to file MSME-1.",
        "filingMethod": "Form MSME-1 is filed exclusively online through the Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ MCA21 (V3) portal. The process typically involves: (1) Logging into the MCA V3 portal with the company’s credentials; (2) Accessing the MSME-1 e-form (often as a web-based or downloadable e-form on the V3 interface); (3) Entering basic company information – Corporate Identity Number (CIN) or Foreign Company Registration Number (FCRN), company name, registered office address, email ID, PAN, and details of the person responsible (Director/CFO/CS, with DIN or PAN as required); (4) Selecting the reporting period type (half-yearly) and specifying whether the return pertains to April–September or October–March; (5) Providing supplier-wise information for all registered Micro and Small Enterprise suppliers to whom payments have been delayed beyond 45 days, including supplier name, PAN, amount due or delayed, the date from which the amount became due, and reason for delay in payment; (6) Running pre-scrutiny/validation checks built into the V3 system; (7) Applying a valid Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) of an authorised signatory (Director, CFO or Company Secretary) to digitally sign the form; and (8) Uploading the e-form and, if applicable, paying any prescribed filing fee under the Companies (Registration Offices and Fees) Rules (many guidance sources state that MSME-1 typically has no ROC filing fee, but companies should verify the current fee table in the MCA Rules for the relevant year). No physical filing or paper submission is required.",
        "prerequisites": "Key prerequisites for accurate MSME-1 compliance include: (1) Identifying MSE suppliers: Maintain an updated list of suppliers who are registered as Micro or Small Enterprises under the MSMED Act (via Udyam). Obtain copies of their Udyam Registration Certificates or at least their Udyam Registration Numbers and classification (Micro/Small), and review periodically; (2) Contract and invoice records: Maintain clear records of purchase orders, supply contracts, invoices, and delivery/acceptance documentation, so that the \"date of acceptance\" or \"deemed acceptance\" can be determined for each transaction; (3) Ageing analysis: Maintain an invoice-wise ageing report specifically for MSE suppliers, tracking days outstanding from the date of acceptance/deemed acceptance to payment, to identify invoices crossing the 45-day threshold; (4) Internal controls: Set up internal processes or system flags to identify whenever an invoice to an MSE supplier crosses 45 days, because even a single such instance in a half-year triggers MSME-1 filing; (5) Board/management oversight: It is good practice (and sometimes required by internal policies) to place a note before the Board or Audit Committee summarising MSE dues and MSME-1 filings; (6) Authorised signatories: Ensure that at least one Director, CFO, or Company Secretary has an active DIN/PAN record and a valid Digital Signature Certificate registered on the MCA portal for signing the e-form; (7) Reconciliation with MSMED obligations: Align MSME-1 data with the interest obligations and payments under the MSMED Act (including any claims through MSEFC/SAMADHAAN) so that disclosures are consistent.",
        "recentUpdates": "Significant 2024–2025 developments affecting MSME-1 compliance from the available search results include: (1) Expanded trigger for filing: A 2024 expert analysis of the revised MSME-1 form notes a new proviso requiring that Form MSME-1 be furnished for a half-year if the company has made even a single delayed payment to any MSE supplier during that period, not only when amounts are outstanding beyond 45 days on the reporting date. A 2025 TaxGuru article on the \"V3 era\" of MSME-1 reinforces that if any payment exceeds 45 days even once, or remains pending beyond 45 days at the half-year end, MSME-1 filing becomes mandatory. This is a practical expansion from the earlier interpretation focusing primarily on outstanding dues as of 31 March or 30 September; (2) Notification S.O. 1376(E) dated 25.03.2025: A March 2025 notification (reported in legal commentary) clarifies that all companies that receive supplies from Micro and Small Enterprises and whose payments to such suppliers exceed 45 days must submit a half-yearly return to MCA. This consolidates and emphasises the obligation for all qualifying companies, regardless of size, and affirms the half-yearly nature of the return; (3) V3 portal and form changes: Several 2025 articles discuss the migration of MSME-1 to the MCA V3 portal and associated changes: the form now more clearly structures information into sections such as (a) Company Information (CIN/FCRN, name, registered office address, email ID, PAN), (b) Return/Reporting Period (type of return – half-yearly – and choice between April–September or October–March), and (c) detailed supplier-wise tables capturing overdue beyond 45 days, reasons for delay, etc. The requirement for digital signatures by a Director, CFO, or Company Secretary is reiterated; (4) Reinforced due dates: Multiple 2025 sources (including practical guides and examples) confirm that, for 2025 onwards, the due dates remain 31 October for the April–September half-year and 30 April for the October–March half-year, with specific illustration that the return for April–September 2025 must be filed by 31 October 2025. One guide notes that MCA has explicitly announced or confirmed the MSME Form 1 due dates for financial year 2025–26 on its official website; (5) Clarified scope of suppliers: A 2025 detailed article reiterates that medium enterprises are not covered under this reporting requirement – only Micro and Small Enterprises are to be considered as MSE suppliers for MSME-1. This is consistent with the language of the MSMED Act and the 2019 Order; (6) Penalty clarifications: Recent guidance articles continue to cite Section 405(4) as the basis for penalty on non-filing or incorrect filing of MSME-1. There is some divergence between sources – older ones cite fines up to ₹25,000 for the company and ₹25,000–₹3,00,000 (or up to ₹1,00,000) for officers, whereas more recent ones reflect the post-decriminalisation penalty structure with a fixed base penalty (₹20,000) and a per-day penalty (₹1,000) up to an overall cap (often cited as ₹3,00,000). Another 2025 news article highlights that companies may face penalties up to ₹3,00,000 for not filing MSME-1; (7) Distinction between filer and beneficiary: Updated guides stress that MSME-1 is not filed by the MSME units themselves; it is filed by buying companies that delay payments beyond 45 days. MSMEs seeking redress must use the MSME SAMADHAAN system to approach the MSE Facilitation Council, which is expected (per the official portal) to decide cases within 90 days; (8) Due date guides for 2025: 2025 due-date compilation resources classify MSME Form 1 as a half-yearly return, with last dates 30 April (for October–March) and 31 October (for April–September); they clearly distinguish this from other MSME-related compliances such as the MSME Udyam Annual Update, which is an MSME-side requirement rather than a companies’ disclosure; (9) Strengthened linkage to broader MSME policy: 2025 articles emphasize that compliance with the 45-day MSME payment rule is a regulatory requirement for all businesses, and that MSME-1 is one of several tools (alongside SAMADHAAN, income-tax disallowance rules introduced separately, etc.) being used by regulators to enforce timely payments to micro and small enterprises.",

Step 3: Check whether you are a non-audit case: individuals filing ITR-1 typically do not require a tax audit, so they fall in the non-audit category. Step 4: Under section 139(1), the statutory due date for non-audit individual taxpayers is normally 31 July of the assessment year (31 July 2025). Step 5: Apply the specific extensions notified for AY 2025-26: (a) extension from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 for non-audit cases including ITR-1 to ITR-4 (as per PIB Press Note and supporting guidance articles); (b) further extension from 15 September 2025 to 16 September 2025 as per the 'News & e-Campaigns' page of the Income Tax portal dated 06 September 2025. Step 6: The effective last date without late fee or interest for delay (subject to tax already paid) is therefore 16 September 2025. Example: A salaried individual with only salary and bank interest income should file their ITR-1 for FY 2024-25 any time on or before 16 September 2025 to avoid 234F late fee and 234A interest (assuming full taxes are paid by then).",

          "penalty": "Monetary penalties and interest for late filing of ITR-1 for AY 2025-26 are as follows: (1) Late filing fee under section 234F: If the return is filed after the due date u/s 139(1) (here, after 16 September 2025) but on or before 31 March 2026, a late fee is levied as per official penalty charts and multiple guidance sources: (a) where total income does not exceed ₹5,00,000, the late filing fee is capped at ₹1,000; (b) where total income exceeds ₹5,00,000, the late filing fee is ₹5,000. Several sources (ClearTax, Angel One, Neeraj Bhagat & Co., and the official penalties chart on incometaxindia.gov.in) confirm that for AY 2025-26, the fee under section 234F is ₹1,000 or ₹5,000 depending on the ₹5 lakh income threshold, with maximum fee ₹5,000. (2) Interest under section 234A: If any self-assessment tax remains unpaid as on the original statutory due date (31 July 2025 for non-audit individuals) or as on the extended due date treated as the effective due date, interest at 1% per month or part of a month is payable on the unpaid tax amount from the due date until the date of actual filing/payment. Multiple sources (ClearTax late-tax-return article, Angel One penalty article, PIB note) explicitly mention a monthly 1% interest on pending tax for delayed filing. Example: If ₹20,000 of tax remains unpaid and the return is filed 3 months after the due date, interest under section 234A would be 1% × 3 months × ₹20,000 = ₹600 (months counted as full months for any part of a month). (3) Interest under sections 234B and 234C: If the taxpayer is liable to pay advance tax and either fails to pay it or pays less than 90% of assessed tax, interest u/s 234B at 1% per month on the shortfall from 1 April 2025 till date of payment is applicable. For shortfalls in individual advance tax instalments, interest u/s 234C at 1% per month on the shortfall in each instalment period applies; guidance sources (TOI article, EMSME article) note that each missed or short-paid instalment suffers interest at 1% per month on the shortfall, and each missed instalment is treated separately. (4) Non-monetary consequences mentioned in the official ITR-1 FAQ include: inability to carry forward certain losses (e.g., business losses, capital losses) if the return is filed after the due date, and certain deductions and exemptions (particularly many under Chapter VI-A and some incentive sections) may not be available if the return is belated. (5) Other penalties mentioned in guidance sources (like ranges of ₹10,000 to ₹1,00,000 under some sections, and fees under section 234E for TDS statements) are separate compliances and do not alter the standard 234F and 234A/234B/234C framework for late filing of ITR-1."

          "penalty": "For ITR-3, the same late filing fee and interest provisions apply as for other ITRs, but business taxpayers must be particularly attentive because (1) they are more likely to have advance tax obligations, and (2) many rely on loss set-off/carry-forward and deductions which can be lost if returns are belated. The penalty structure, based on official and guidance sources, is: (1) Section 234F late filing fee: If ITR-3 is filed after the applicable due date u/s 139(1) (16 September 2025 for non-audit or 10 December 2025 for audit) but before 31 March 2026, the assessee must pay: (a) ₹1,000 where total income does not exceed ₹5,00,000, or (b) ₹5,000 where total income exceeds ₹5,00,000. This is explicitly reflected in the incometaxindia.gov.in penalties chart and multiple AY 2025-26 penalty explanations (Angel One, TOI, Neeraj Bhagat). The maximum late fee for AY 2025-26 as per these sources is ₹5,000. (2) Section 234A interest: Late filing when tax is unpaid as of the due date triggers interest at 1% per month or part of a month on the unpaid tax amount from the due date until the date of filing/payment. PIB and several private portals emphasize that this 1% per month interest is in addition to the 234F late fee. Example: If a business proprietor owes ₹100,000 in self-assessment tax as of 16 September 2025 but files and pays only on 20 December 2025 (roughly 3 full months delayed after due date), interest u/s 234A would be approximately 1% × 3 × ₹100,000 = ₹3,000, plus the applicable 234F fee. (3) Sections 234B and 234C interest for advance tax: Business taxpayers are more likely to meet advance tax criteria. TOI and EMSME sources state that late or short payment of advance tax attracts interest up to 1% per month on the shortfall: under section 234B for failure to pay at least 90% of assessed tax as advance tax, interest at 1% per month on the shortfall from 1 April 2025 until payment; under section 234C for shortfall in each advance tax instalment, interest at 1% per month (for the specified number of months per instalment) on the shortfall in each instalment, with each instalment treated separately. (4) Non-monetary implications indicated in the ITR-1 FAQ apply to ITR-3 as well: belated ITR-3 filing may prevent the assessee from carrying forward business losses and certain other losses, and can block some deductions and tax incentives (e.g., several profit-linked deductions requiring timely filing). (5) Separate penalties and fees mentioned in search results (sections 234E and 234G for defaults in TDS/TCS statements and research/donation-related statements, and 271H penalty waivers for delayed TDS/TCS statements effective AY 2025-26) do not directly relate to late filing of ITR-3 but may impact SMEs that are required to deduct tax at source; these are separate from the 234F and 234A/B/C framework affecting the ITR itself."

          "description": "ITR-4 (Sugam) is a simplified return form designed for small taxpayers opting for presumptive taxation. As per incometax.gov.in ITR-4 FAQs and the official ITR-4 form (itr4_english.pdf) for AY 2025-26, ITR-4 can be used by a resident individual, resident HUF, or firm (other than LLP) whose total income does not exceed ₹50 lakh (₹5,000,000) and who has business income computed under sections 44AD (presumptive income for eligible businesses), 44ADA (presumptive income for specified professions) or 44AE (presumptive income for transporters owning not more than the specified number of goods carriages), along with permissible income from salary/pension, one house property and other sources. It is not available to non-residents, LLPs, or persons with certain types of income such as income from more than one house property, capital gains, speculative business, agricultural income above certain limits, or foreign assets/foreign income. For SMEs, this is the primary form for small proprietorships and partnership firms (other than LLPs) that choose to compute profit as a fixed percentage of turnover or gross receipts under the presumptive schemes.",

This reflects the initial extension from the normal 31 July 2025 date. However, the Income Tax Department's latest-news page later extended the due date for filing ITRs for AY 2025-26 from 15 September 2025 to 16 September 2025, which applies to all non-audit ITR filers including ITR-4. Therefore, the final extended due date for ITR-4 for non-audit presumptive taxpayers is 16 September 2025.",
            "calculation": "Step 1: Confirm eligibility for ITR-4: the taxpayer must be a resident individual, resident HUF or firm (not LLP), with total income up to ₹50 lakh and eligible presumptive business/professional income under sections 44AD/44ADA/44AE, and must not fall in any excluded category (for example, non-resident status, presence of capital gains or multiple house properties etc.). Step 2: Determine that such tax cases are typically non-audit under the Income-tax Act, as presumptive provisions generally exempt the assessee from maintaining detailed books and tax audit (subject to certain exceptions, such as voluntarily declaring profits lower than the presumptive rate while exceeding specified turnover limits). Step 3: Take the standard non-audit due date for AY 2025-26, which is 31 July 2025, and apply the published extensions: the PIB note and ITR-4 FAQ confirm an extension to 15 September 2025; the latest-news page then confirms a further extension to 16 September 2025. Step 4: Use 16 September 2025 as the effective last date to file ITR-4 without late fee and interest for delay (assuming taxes are already fully paid).",
            "gracePeriod": "No formal grace period exists beyond the extended date. Filing ITR-4 after 16 September 2025 means the return is belated u/s 139(4), with 234F late fee and 234A interest on any unpaid tax, and collateral consequences such as loss of carry forward of certain losses and some deduction restrictions.",
            "extensions": "The official extension trail for ITR-4 for AY 2025-26 is: (1) Normal non-audit due date: 31 July 2025. (2) Press Information Bureau note dated 7 September 2025 clarifying that for non-audit cases including filers under ITR-1 to ITR-4, the deadline has been extended from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025. (3) Incometax.gov.in ITR-4 FAQ updated to state that the due date for filing ITR-4 for AY 2025-26 is 15 September 2025. (4) Income Tax Department latest-news page (News & e-Campaigns) announcing that the due date for filing ITRs for AY 2025-26 has been further extended from 15 September 2025 to 16 September 2025. The ITR-4 FAQ text may not yet reflect this final 1-day extension, but the latest-news page and several guidance sites (ClearTax, Bajaj Finserv) confirm the operative last date as 16 September 2025."
          },
          "penalty": "ITR-4 filers are subject to the same late filing fee and interest rules as other individual/HUF/firm taxpayers: (1) Late filing fee u/s 234F: For AY 2025-26, the late fee for filing ITR-4 after the due date (16 September 2025) is: ₹1,000 if total income is up to ₹5,00,000; ₹5,000 if total income exceeds ₹5,00,000. These thresholds and amounts are explicitly cited in the incometaxindia.gov.in penalties chart (which states that when total income is up to ₹5 lakh, the late filing fees is ₹1,000) and in multiple private guidance articles (Neeraj Bhagat, Angel One, TOI, ClearTax). Maximum late fee is therefore ₹5,000 for AY 2025-26. (2) Section 234A interest: Late filing where tax remains unpaid as of the due date triggers 1% per month (or part) interest on the unpaid tax from the due date (16 September 2025 after taking into account the extension) until the date of actual filing and payment. PIB and guidance sources stress that this is 1% per month on the pending tax amount in addition to the 234F fee. (3) Sections 234B and 234C: Even though presumptive taxpayers often pay much of their tax as self-assessment in a lump sum, they can still be liable to advance tax, and default or deferment triggers interest u/s 234B and 234C at 1% per month on the shortfall during prescribed periods, as described in EMSME and TOI articles. (4) Non-filing or late filing also results in the loss of certain tax planning benefits: the official ITR-1 FAQ mentions that a delay in filing returns may prevent the carry-forward of eligible losses and make some deductions and exemptions unavailable; this applies to ITR-4 as well. (5) Other penalty/fee provisions mentioned in the search results, like section 234E (late fee of ₹200 per day for delay in furnishing TDS/TCS statements), section 234G (fee for default in submission of statements/certificates under sections 35 and 80G), and penalty ranges of ₹10,000 to ₹1,00,000 under other sections discussed in some private articles, relate to other compliances (TDS/TCS or certificates) and not to the ITR-4 filing itself, and therefore are separate from the 234F and 234A/B/C framework for ITR-4."

          "description": "Form 10IEA is a separate form referenced in the official ITR-3 form for AY 2025-26. The ITR-3 PDF clearly includes a note that the option under section 115BAC(6) (which allows eligible individuals and HUFs with business/professional income to opt out of the default new tax regime or exercise an option with respect to the regime) should be exercised in Form 10IEA on or before the due date for filing the return under section 139(1). This form is applicable primarily to individuals and HUFs who have income from business or profession and want to choose or change their tax regime (old vs new) in accordance with section 115BAC. For SMEs, this is crucial for proprietors and HUF businesses filing ITR-3 or potentially ITR-4 who need to formally notify the tax department of their regime choice.",

The ITR-3 form explicitly states that the option under section 115BAC(6) should be exercised in Form 10IEA on or before the due date for filing the return under section 139(1). Thus, for AY 2025-26: (1) Non-audit business/professional cases (e.g., small proprietors using ITR-3 but not under audit): due date for Form 10IEA is aligned to their ITR-3 due date of 16 September 2025. (2) Audit cases (e.g., ITR-3 filers whose accounts are audited under section 44AB): due date for Form 10IEA is aligned to their extended audit-case ITR-3 due date of 10 December 2025.",

Step 2: Determine whether the case is audit or non-audit and identify the applicable due date under section 139(1) for the relevant ITR (16 September 2025 for non-audit, 10 December 2025 for audit in AY 2025-26). Step 3: Ensure that Form 10IEA is e-filed on the portal on or before that due date. Failing to file Form 10IEA within this timeline generally results in the taxpayer being treated as having not validly exercised the option, causing default treatment under the default tax regime prescribed under section 115BAC. Example: A resident individual proprietor with business income who wishes to continue under the old tax regime for AY 2025-26 and is a non-audit case must submit Form 10IEA online by 16 September 2025, along with or before filing ITR-3.",
            "gracePeriod": "There is no separate statutory grace period for filing Form 10IEA beyond the due date u/s 139(1). If Form 10IEA is not furnished by the applicable due date, the option under section 115BAC(6) may not be available for that year, and the taxpayer may be forced into the default regime as per the law.",
            "extensions": "Form 10IEA’s deadline automatically benefits from the same extensions as the ITR due dates, because the ITR-3 note ties its deadline explicitly to the ITR due date u/s 139(1). Therefore, for AY 2025-26: (1) non-audit cases benefit from the extension of the due date from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 (PIB) and then to 16 September 2025 (e-filing portal news); (2) audit cases benefit from the extension from 31 October 2025 to 10 December 2025 through CBDT Circular No. 15/2025."
          },
          "penalty": "There is no specific late fee amount prescribed in the search results for delayed filing of Form 10IEA itself. The primary consequence of failing to file Form 10IEA by the due date u/s 139(1) is that the taxpayer is treated as not having validly exercised the option under section 115BAC(6). As a result, they may be locked into the default tax regime (currently the new regime for many individuals) and may not be able to claim deductions and exemptions that are only available in the old regime, which can increase their tax liability. This is a substantive tax consequence rather than a separate monetary penalty or late fee. However, because Form 10IEA must accompany or precede timely filing of the ITR, a delay that also causes delayed ITR filing will attract the usual 234F late filing fee and 234A/234B/234C interest applicable to the ITR."

On first use, the taxpayer must create an e-filing account using PAN, validate contact details and secure login credentials. For some categories (e.g., companies, firms subject to audit), a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) is required to sign the ITR electronically; others may use Electronic Verification Code (EVC) methods such as Aadhaar OTP, pre-validated bank account or demat account. The help page for salaried individuals refers to helplines (1800 103 0025, 1800 419 0025 and +91-80-46122000) available typically during working hours (around 08:00 to 20:00 Monday to Friday) to assist with e-filing of ITRs and forms.",

Forms ITR-1, ITR-2, ITR-3 and ITR-4 can be filed: (1) Online directly in the browser using pre-filled data and step-wise wizards on the portal; or (2) Offline by downloading the Common Offline Utility (as referenced in the Downloads page – a ZIP utility of about 30.1 MB, version 1.2.5 for AY 2025-26), preparing the return in the utility and then generating and uploading a JSON file to the portal. For most taxpayers, physical (paper) filing is no longer permitted except in limited cases not detailed in the search results (such as very senior citizens meeting specific criteria). After electronic submission, the return must be verified (e-verified) via Aadhaar OTP, pre-validated bank/demat account, Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) or other approved EVC methods within the prescribed time to be treated as validly filed.",
        "prerequisites": "Key prerequisites for compliant ITR filing for SMEs and individuals include: (1) Valid PAN for the taxpayer and, where applicable, TAN for TDS-related compliances; (2) Aadhaar-PAN linkage for individuals; (3) Registration on the e-filing portal with up-to-date contact information and bank account details (for refunds); (4) Maintenance of necessary books of account and records, especially for ITR-3 business/professional cases and for those potentially subject to audit under section 44AB; (5) Computation of total income including all heads (salary, house property, business/profession, capital gains, other sources) with segregation of presumptive vs non-presumptive income where relevant; (6) Determination and payment of advance tax where applicable to avoid or reduce interest under sections 234B and 234C (as highlighted in EMSME and TOI articles, which explain that interest at 1% per month applies on shortfalls for each unpaid or underpaid instalment, treating each instalment separately); (7) Payment of self-assessment tax before filing to minimize 234A interest; (8) For those intending to opt into or out of the new tax regime under section 115BAC(6), preparation and e-filing of Form 10IEA on or before the ITR due date (explicitly required in the ITR-3 form for AY 2025-26); and (9) For entities required to deduct tax at source (TDS/TCS), timely deposit of TDS/TCS (e.g., the Tax Calendar notes that TDS/TCS collected/deducted in October 2025 is generally due for deposit by 7 November 2025) and timely filing of TDS/TCS statements to avoid associated late fees under section 234E, even though penalties under section 271H for delay in TDS/TCS statements have been relaxed from AY 2025-26 as per the incometaxindia.gov.in penalty tutorial.",
        "recentUpdates": "The 2025-related updates and changes captured in the search results that are relevant to ITR compliance for AY 2025-26 (FY 2024-25) include: (1) Extension of non-audit ITR due date: The usual due date of 31 July 2025 for non-audit taxpayers (including individuals filing ITR-1 to ITR-4) was extended to 15 September 2025 as per a Press Information Bureau note dated 7 September 2025 titled '15 September 2025: ITR Deadline – What Every Taxpayer Should Know', which clarifies that the extension is for non-audit cases including filers under ITR-1 to ITR-4. Subsequently, an official update on the Income Tax Department’s 'News & e-Campaigns' page announced that the due date for filing ITRs for AY 2025-26 has been extended from 15 September 2025 to 16 September 2025. Some communications (such as the Newsonair item on 15 September 2025) initially reiterated 15 September as the last date, but the later portal update prevails, making 16 September 2025 the final due date for non-audit ITR-1 to ITR-4 filers. (2) Clarification on audit-case ITR due date: For cases where the original statutory due date was 31 October 2025 (generally taxpayers whose accounts are required to be audited under section 44AB or partners of such firms filing ITR-3 or other relevant forms), CBDT issued Circular No. 15/2025 dated 29 October 2025 and a press release extending the due date for furnishing the Return of Income for AY 2025-26 from 31 October 2025 to 10 December 2025. The Income Tax Department home page explicitly references this extension. (3) Form updates for AY 2025-26: New versions of ITR-3 and ITR-4 forms were notified for AY 2025-26 (e.g., the ITR-3 form PDF dated 1 May 2025 and the ITR-4 English PDF). Articles such as 'Key Updates to ITR Forms for AY 2025-26' on India Briefing summarize functional changes (though detailed changes are not fully visible in the snippets), and the ITR-3 form now clearly references Form 10IEA for exercising the 115BAC(6) option. (4) Introduction/Use of Form 10IEA: The ITR-3 form specifically instructs that the option under section 115BAC(6) must be exercised in Form 10IEA on or before the due date for filing the return u/s 139(1), highlighting this form as a key compliance requirement for individuals and HUFs with business/professional income choosing between the new and old tax regimes. (5) Offline utility release for AY 2025-26: The Income Tax Department’s Downloads page indicates that a Common Offline Utility (ZIP, version 1.2.5, ~30.1 MB) is available for filing ITR-1, ITR-2, ITR-3 and ITR-4 for AY 2025-26, enabling offline preparation and JSON upload. (6) Clarifications and campaigns: The Department has used official channels (PIB, Newsonair, News & e-Campaigns) to clarify due dates and discourage reliance on unverified social media rumors about extensions, emphasizing that taxpayers should refer to official notifications. (7) Penalty regime commentary: Multiple 2025-dated guidance pieces reiterate that for AY 2025-26, late filing of ITRs attracts a fee under section 234F of ₹1,000 or ₹5,000 (depending on whether total income is up to or above ₹5 lakh) and interest at 1% per month on unpaid tax under section 234A, as well as interest under sections 234B and 234C for default/deferment of advance tax. (8) Change in TDS/TCS penalty: The incometaxindia.gov.in tutorial on 'Late Filing Fees and Penalty' notes that with effect from Assessment Year 2025-26, no penalty under section 271H will be levied merely in case of delay in filing TDS/TCS statements, although late fee u/s 234E still applies. While this change pertains to TDS/TCS statement filing rather than the main ITR, it is a noteworthy 2025 compliance relaxation for SMEs that deduct TDS. Overall, the 2025 cycle emphasizes timely ITR e-filing using updated forms and utilities, careful attention to extended but final due dates (16 September 2025 for non-audit and 10 December 2025 for audit cases for AY 2025-26), and the proper exercise of tax-regime options via Form 10IEA for business/professional taxpayers."

      "category": "Tax",
      "applicability": {
        "condition": "Tax audit in India refers to the mandatory audit of accounts under section 44AB of the Income-tax Act, 1961. It applies to persons carrying on business or profession (including individuals, HUFs, partnership firms, LLPs, companies and other entities) when specified turnover/gross receipt and other conditions are met. Based on the search results for AY 2025-26 (FY 2024-25) and general section 44AB rules as cited, the principal conditions are: (1) Businesses: A taxpayer carrying on business must get accounts audited if total sales/turnover/gross receipts exceed ₹1 crore in a financial year (as stated in multiple articles including ClearTax section 44AB, Bajaj Finserv, Tax2Win, EFileTax, Suvit and others). If the aggregate of cash receipts and cash payments does not exceed 5% of total receipts and payments (meaning at least 95% transactions are digital/non-cash), the turnover threshold for tax audit increases to ₹10 crore in that financial year (ClearTax 44AB, KDKSoftware, Tax2Win, TheLegalSchool and EFileTax snippets). EFileTax summarizes this as: if turnover exceeds ₹1 crore or if digital payments are less than 95% (i.e., cash transactions above 5%), tax audit becomes applicable. (2) Professionals: A taxpayer carrying on a specified profession must get accounts audited if gross receipts exceed ₹50 lakh in a financial year, as highlighted for section 44AB(b) in TheLegalSchool and Suvit articles. (3) Presumptive business (section 44AD): TaxGuru and related articles (AY 2024-25 focus) state that if business turnover does not exceed ₹2 crore and the taxpayer declares 6% or 8% of turnover as income under the presumptive scheme, no tax audit is required. However, if the taxpayer declares income lower than the presumptive rate and total income exceeds the basic exemption limit, a tax audit under section 44AB becomes mandatory. (4) Business loss: Bajaj Finserv’s 44AB explainer notes that even in case of business loss, if the turnover exceeds ₹1 crore, tax audit is applicable. In practice this interacts with presumptive schemes and the basic exemption limit (a business reporting loss or profit below presumptive norms with total income above the exemption threshold is typically brought into tax audit). (5) Statutory audit under other law: Entities already required to have their accounts audited under another law (e.g., Companies Act for companies, LLP Act, co-operative societies etc.) are still required to obtain tax audit under section 44AB if the monetary thresholds are crossed. For such entities, Form 3CA is used, which refers to and attaches the statutory audit report (ClearTax article on Forms 3CA, 3CB, 3CD, 3CE; eBizFiling article on tax audit for private limited companies). (6) Measurement base: The ICMAI supplementary paper on Tax Audit notes that applicability depends on 'sales', 'turnover' or 'gross receipts' but the Act itself does not define these terms, and practitioners rely on guidance notes/standards for interpretation. Tax audit applies on a PAN-based, per-assessee basis for each business/profession, consolidated across that assessee’s operations.",

          "Cases where the assessee was technically required to obtain a tax audit but failed to do so may still escape penalty under section 271B if they can demonstrate 'reasonable cause' for the failure under section 273B; this does not remove the legal obligation but can mitigate penalties (this reasonable-cause relief is referred to indirectly in eBizFiling’s 'Relief is ...' note on penalties and is part of the standard penalty regime).",

The form summarizes the auditor’s opinion for tax purposes and makes reference to the existing statutory audit report. Form 3CD is a detailed 'Statement of particulars required to be furnished under section 44AB', listing numerous clauses (PDICAI notes reference 35 reporting points for the 3CA–3CD combination) requiring disclosure of quantitative and qualitative particulars such as nature of business, details of depreciation, disallowable expenses, compliance with TDS/TCS provisions, particulars of loans/deposits, related-party transactions, and other specific reporting. For entities like private limited companies, eBizFiling’s 2025 article clarifies that tax audit is in addition to the mandatory statutory company audit and is reported through Form 3CA-3CD.

Under the FAQs on Tax Audit at incometaxindia.gov.in, the assessee must get the accounts audited and obtain the audit report on or before 30 September of the relevant assessment year. Thus, for FY 2024-25, the statutory base due date is 30 September 2025. The same timeline applies both for 'obtaining' the report from the CA and for e-filing the report on the portal. The CA uploads Form 3CA-3CD through their CA login, and the assessee approves it on or before the due date.",

However, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) frequently exercises its administrative powers to extend due dates for tax audit reports for specific years via circulars and press releases, effectively acting as a one-time grace extension for that year.",
            "extensions": "For FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26), several extensions are reflected in 2025 sources: (1) Base statutory due date: 30 September 2025, as per the general FAQs on Tax Audit on incometaxindia.gov.in and articles such as Economic Times (20 Sept 2025) and Legalwiz (30 Aug 2025) which refer to 30 September 2025 as the normal tax audit deadline. (2) First extension to 31 October 2025: The Income Tax Department’s 'News & e-Campaigns' page (official portal) specifically notes that the due date for filing of audit report has been extended from 30 September 2025 to 31 October 2025 in the case of assessees referred in clause (a) of the relevant provision (i.e., audit cases under section 139(1)). This is echoed in the AcumenGroup article 'Income Tax Audit Report Due Date Extended FY 2024-25', which states that the new deadline was originally 30 September 2025 but, in the latest CBDT Circular No. 14/2025, it became 31 October 2025. ClearTax’s 'Comprehensive Analysis of Tax Audit: Forms 3CA, 3CB, 3CD, 3CE' also notes that a taxpayer has to obtain the audit report on or before 31 October 2025 for FY 2024-25 (consistent with this first extension). (3) CBDT Circular No. 14/2025: The official Circular No. 14/2025 dated 25 September 2025 (available as a PDF on incometaxindia.gov.in) is titled 'Extension of timelines for filing of various reports of audit for Financial Year 2024-25 (relevant to Assessment Year 2025-26)' and formalises extensions for various audit reports for FY 2024-25; based on secondary summaries (AcumenGroup, ClearTax), it initially extended the due date to 31 October 2025. (4) Further extension to 10 November 2025: ClearTax’s dedicated section 44AB article dated 30 October 2025 explicitly states that the due date for submitting the tax audit report is further extended to 10 November 2025 for FY 2024-25. TaxGuru’s article of 31 October 2025, 'CBDT Extends Tax Audit & ITR Deadlines for AY 2025–26', confirms that 'CBDT extends Tax Audit Report deadline to Nov 10, 2025, and ITR for non-TP audit cases to Dec 10, 2025; TP cases must file ITR by Nov 30.' Thus, the effective final due date for filing Form 3CA-3CD for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) is 10 November 2025. (5) Media and private guidance sites (Times of India, Bajaj Finserv, Economic Times) reported intermediate positions – e.g., Times of India (26 Sept 2025) and Bajaj Finserv (late October 2025) discussed 31 October 2025 as the audit deadline – but these were superseded by the later CBDT extension to 10 November 2025. The PDICAI news item that 'the deadline remains unchanged – September 30, 2025' reflects the situation before extensions."
          },
          "penalty": "Failure to get books audited and/or furnish the tax audit report in Form 3CA-3CD on or before the prescribed/extended due date attracts penalty under section 271B of the Income-tax Act, as consistently described in multiple 2025 guidance sources (Bajaj Finserv, Legalwiz, eBizFiling, Fortune India, PKC India and the analysis of Clause 446 of the Income Tax Bill, 2025). The core penalty structure is: (1) Quantum: Penalty is equal to the lower of (a) 0.5% (one-half per cent) of the total sales, turnover or gross receipts of the business or profession in the relevant previous year; or (b) ₹150,000 (₹1.5 lakh). Bajaj Finserv’s 'Income Tax Audit Under Section 44AB' article states that 'Non-compliance may result in a penalty of 0.5% of turnover (max Rs. 1.5 lakh)' and eBizFiling’s 'Tax Audit for Private Limited Companies 2025' article states that 'A penalty of 0.5% of turnover or ₹1,50,000 (whichever is lower) may be levied under Section 271B.' The Taxtmi note on Clause 446 vs Section 271B likewise notes that non-compliance penalties are substantial but capped at ₹1,50,000. Fortune India’s article on consequences of missing the tax audit filing deadline explains that penalty under section 271B is 0.5% of turnover/gross receipts. (2) Minimum penalty: The law does not prescribe a separate flat minimum monetary penalty; theoretically, the penalty is 0 if the assessee successfully invokes section 273B (reasonable cause) and the tax authority chooses not to levy any penalty. Where levied, the practical minimum is 0.5% of turnover/gross receipts, subject to the ₹150,000 cap (for very small turnovers, 0.5% of turnover can be much lower than ₹150,000). (3) Per-day late fee and interest: Section 271B does not stipulate a per-day late fee or interest rate specifically for late filing of Form 3CA-3CD. The penalty is a one-time computation based on turnover/gross receipts and is independent of the number of days of delay. However, late or non-filing of the associated income tax return may attract separate late fees under section 234F and interest under sections 234A, 234B and 234C, but those are not tax-audit-specific and are not detailed in the provided search results. (4) Reasonable cause defence: Although not elaborated in the snippets, standard law (and referenced in commentary like eBizFiling’s 'Relief is ...' remark) provides that no penalty shall be imposed under section 271B if the assessee proves that there was reasonable cause for failure (section 273B). (5) Additional company law penalties: PKC India’s analysis of penalties for non-compliance with statutory audit notes that, separate from Income-tax Act penalties, the Companies Act can levy fines ranging from around ₹25,000 to ₹500,000 for failures related to statutory audit. Thus, for companies, non-compliance can simultaneously expose them to (a) tax audit penalty of up to 0.5% of turnover capped at ₹150,000, and (b) Companies Act fines for statutory audit defaults. (6) Future codification: The Taxtmi article on Clause 446 of the Income Tax Bill, 2025 suggests that the proposed new Income Tax Bill retains a similar penalty framework, with penalties significant for large businesses but capped at ₹150,000, mirroring the current section 271B regime."

          "penalty": "The penalty regime for late or non-filing of Form 3CB-3CD is identical to that for Form 3CA-3CD because both are tax audit reports under section 44AB.

This 0.5% of turnover/gross receipts ceiling is emphasised in multiple articles. (2) Nature: It is a one-time penalty; there is no statutory per-day late fee for delay in uploading the audit report. The law does not tie the penalty amount to the number of days of delay; it only looks at the fact of non-compliance with the due date. (3) Minimum/maximum: The maximum penalty is ₹150,000. The effective minimum can be nil if the assessee proves 'reasonable cause' under section 273B and the officer chooses not to levy any penalty. Otherwise, the practical minimum (if levied) is 0.5% of the reported turnover/gross receipts for that year if that amount is less than ₹150,000. (4) Other consequences: Although not specified in the tax-audit-specific articles, delayed tax audit may indirectly cause delayed ITR filing, which in turn can attract late filing fee under section 234F and interest under sections 234A/234B/234C; these apply independently of section 271B. (5) Related statutory audit penalties: For entities that also have statutory audit obligations (e.g., private limited companies), PKC India notes that under the Companies Act, penalties for statutory audit non-compliance can range from ₹25,000 to ₹500,000, separate from tax audit penalties."

          "description": "Form 3CD is a detailed statement of particulars prescribed under Rule 6G, to be furnished along with the tax audit report in Form 3CA or 3CB. Although filed electronically as part of a combined Form 3CA-3CD or 3CB-3CD package, it is a distinct form listing clause-wise disclosures. The PDICAI news item regarding 'Income tax audit forms are now enabled' specifically mentions that there are 35 reporting items in the Form 3CA-3CD combination and 36 in the Form 3CB-3CD combination, indicating the scope and complexity of the particulars required. The Economic Times article on 'Top five changes in income tax audit form 3CD for AY 2025-26' (20 Sept 2025) confirms that Form 3CD has undergone changes for AY 2025-26, implying additional or revised reporting clauses that CAs and SMEs must carefully review. While the snippets do not list those five changes, they signal that the content and number of disclosures in Form 3CD for AY 2025-26 differ from earlier years and require updated compliance. Form 3CD covers, among other matters, details of nature of business/profession, ownership structure, method of accounting, quantitative stock details, depreciation, disallowances under various sections, compliance with TDS/TCS provisions, payments to specified persons, loans and deposits in contravention of sections 269SS/269T, and other specified tax-sensitive disclosures.",

            "calculation": "Because Form 3CD is an integral part of the tax audit report package (3CA-3CD or 3CB-3CD), its due date is not computed separately. For FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26), one first determines the base statutory due date for tax audit reports (30 September 2025), then applies any extensions applicable to audit reports in general. For that year, official and guidance sources show that the due date moved from 30 September 2025 to 31 October 2025 (per CBDT News & e-Campaigns and Circular 14/2025) and ultimately to 10 November 2025 (per ClearTax section 44AB and TaxGuru), so Form 3CD for that FY is effectively due on 10 November 2025.",

Economic Times’ article on 'Top five changes in income tax audit form 3CD for AY 2025-26' underscores that, apart from the extended timelines, the content of Form 3CD has been updated, requiring CAs and assessees to use the latest version of the form for AY 2025-26."

          "penalty": "There is no standalone penalty that applies only to Form 3CD separate from the penalty for the tax audit report itself. Failure to furnish correct or complete particulars in Form 3CD, or failure to furnish the form on time, is treated as failure to comply with section 44AB and attracts penalty under section 271B, computed as the lower of 0.5% of turnover/gross receipts or ₹150,000, as explained across Bajaj Finserv, Legalwiz, eBizFiling, Fortune India and PKC India articles. In serious cases involving false statements or misreporting, other penalty or prosecution provisions (e.g., for furnishing inaccurate information) may separately apply under the Income-tax Act, but these are beyond what is detailed in the provided search results. There is no per-day penalty tied specifically to Form 3CD; timing and completeness are enforced via the general section 271B framework and the reasonable-cause relief under section 273B."

It is mentioned in the context of audit-related forms but is not the primary audit report form for standard SME businesses or professions.

In general, failure to furnish an accountant’s report required under the Income-tax Act can attract penalties under the provision corresponding to that report (not necessarily section 271B) and, depending on the section, may also attract broader penalties for non-compliance or misreporting. Because the snippets only signal the existence of Form 3CE in a list of tax audit-related forms without describing its penalty mechanism, assessees should refer to the underlying statutory provision for Form 3CE to determine exact penalties and any applicable reasonable-cause defenses."

      "additionalInfo": {
        "registration": "There is no separate formal registration or license required to become 'tax audit liable'. Instead, applicability flows automatically from section 44AB thresholds. However, procedural prerequisites include: (1) The assessee (SME business or professional) must be registered on the Income Tax e-Filing portal (https://www.incometax.gov.in) using its PAN (and TAN where relevant) and must maintain updated contact details for OTP/EVC and digital signature usage. (2) A Chartered Accountant (CA) who will conduct the tax audit must be registered on the e-Filing portal as a CA, with validated membership number and digital signature certificate (DSC). (3) The assessee must formally assign the tax audit engagement to the CA on the portal (via 'My CA' or equivalent functionality) so that the CA can upload Form 3CA/3CB-3CD for that specific PAN and assessment year. (4) For companies and other entities already having statutory audits, the statutory auditor (or another CA if properly appointed) typically performs the tax audit; their statutory audit report is attached/referenced in Form 3CA.",
        "renewal": "Tax audit under section 44AB is not a registration-based compliance and hence does not involve renewal. It is an annual obligation assessed independently for each financial year based on that year’s turnover/gross receipts, cash/digital transaction mix, presumptive scheme usage, and other conditions. If the entity’s turnover falls below thresholds in a subsequent year or it validly opts for and complies with presumptive schemes, no tax audit may be required for that later year.",
        "filingMethod": "Tax audit reports (Forms 3CA-3CD and 3CB-3CD) are required to be filed electronically. The key method aspects, drawn from PDICAI’s note that 'Income tax audit forms are now enabled', guidance from tax portals, and standard e-Filing practices, are: (1) Preparation: The CA prepares the audit report in the prescribed electronic utility for Forms 3CA/3CB and 3CD (updated each year for changes like the 'top five changes' in Form 3CD) either directly on the e-Filing portal or via offline utilities, validating the forms for all requisite clauses (35 or 36 items as applicable). (2) Upload by CA: The CA logs into the Income Tax e-Filing portal under their CA account, selects the assessee, assessment year (e.g., AY 2025-26), and the relevant form (3CA-3CD or 3CB-3CD) and uploads the digitally signed report using their digital signature certificate. (3) Acceptance by assessee: The assessee logs into their own e-Filing account, views the uploaded audit report under 'Pending for Acceptance' (or similar section), and formally accepts the report. Only after acceptance does the report become a validly filed tax audit report. (4) Linkage with ITR: The ITR form, when filed for an assessee subject to tax audit, auto-links to the accepted audit report acknowledgement number and date; ITR is expected to be filed after the audit report has been successfully e-filed and accepted. (5) Mode: Paper filing or manual submission of Forms 3CA/3CB-3CD is generally not permitted for regular SME taxpayers; electronic filing via the portal is mandatory.",
        "prerequisites": "Key practical prerequisites for SMEs to complete tax audit compliance include: (1) Maintenance of proper books of account for the financial year, including ledgers, cash book, bank statements, invoices, stock records and supporting documents, in a form that can be audited. (2) Completion of any statutory audit under other laws (for companies, LLPs, etc.) so that its findings can be incorporated into Form 3CA where applicable. (3) Timely closure of books, accounting for year-end adjustments such as depreciation, provisions, and inventory valuation so that the CA can complete audit procedures before the due date. (4) Availability of details needed for Form 3CD, including breakdowns of payments liable to TDS/TCS, particulars of loans and deposits, related-party transactions, compliance with sections like 40(a)(ia), 40A(3), 43B, 269SS/269T, quantitative stock information, GST reconciliation and other tax-sensitive data. (5) Appointment of a CA and execution of requisite engagement letters or board/partner resolutions authorising the CA to act as tax auditor and to file the audit report electronically. (6) Functional digital signature certificates for both CA and the assessee’s authorised signatory (for companies/LLPs), or ability to use EVC/OTP where permitted. (7) Awareness of any changes in Form 3CD or in the utilities for that AY (e.g., Economic Times’ reference to 'top five changes in income tax audit form 3CD for AY 2025-26' and PDICAI’s notice that new audit forms with 35/36 clauses are enabled) so that the CA uses the latest format.",
        "recentUpdates": "The 2025 search results capture several important updates and contextual changes relevant to tax audit for SMEs: (1) Deadline extensions for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): (a) Standard due date: Multiple sources, including the official 'FAQs on Tax Audit', Legalwiz’s August 2025 article, and Economic Times’ Sept 2025 article, affirm that the statutory base due date for tax audit reports under section 44AB is 30 September of the relevant assessment year (30 September 2025 for AY 2025-26). (b) First extension to 31 October 2025: The Income Tax Department’s 'News & e-Campaigns' page and AcumenGroup’s 'Income Tax Audit Report Due Date Extended FY 2024-25' article show that CBDT extended the deadline from 30 September 2025 to 31 October 2025 for specified assessees (clause (a) assessees under section 139(1), i.e., audit cases). ClearTax’s forms article (dated 25 Sept 2025) also notes that taxpayers are required to obtain the audit report on or before 31 October 2025 for FY 2024-25. (c) CBDT Circular No. 14/2025: Issued on 25 September 2025, this official circular is titled 'Extension of timelines for filing of various reports of audit for Financial Year 2024-25 (relevant to Assessment Year 2025-26)' and underpins the 31 October 2025 extension for tax audit reports and potentially other audit reports (though the snippet does not list them exhaustively). (d) Further extension to 10 November 2025: ClearTax’s 30 October 2025 section 44AB article states that 'The due date for submitting tax audit report is further extended to 10th November, 2025 for FY 2024-25.' TaxGuru’s 31 October 2025 article explicitly says 'CBDT extends Tax Audit Report deadline to Nov 10, 2025, and ITR for non-TP audit cases to Dec 10, 2025. TP cases must file ITR by Nov 30.' These sources indicate that CBDT issued a subsequent extension beyond Circular 14/2025, moving the final tax audit report due date for FY 2024-25 to 10 November 2025 and ITR due dates for audit cases to 10 December 2025 (non-TP) and 30 November 2025 (TP). (e) Media coverage and intermediate guidance: Times of India (26 Sept 2025) and Bajaj Finserv’s 'Tax Audit Due Date' article (dated a few days before late-October 2025) reported October 31, 2025, as the tax audit deadline. These were correct at that time but were later superseded by the CBDT’s second extension to 10 November 2025. PDICAI’s earlier note reported that the deadline remained 30 September 2025, reflecting a pre-extension timeframe. (2) Changes in Form 3CD for AY 2025-26: Economic Times’ article 'Top five changes in income tax audit form 3CD for AY 2025-26' (20 Sept 2025) indicates that the tax audit reporting format has been materially amended for AY 2025-26, with at least five key changes in Form 3CD. While the snippet does not list them, its existence signals that practitioners and SMEs must adopt a revised Form 3CD with new or modified clauses. PDICAI’s announcement that the income tax audit forms are 'now enabled' and specify 35 clauses for 3CA-3CD and 36 for 3CB-3CD also suggests that a new utility/version of the forms became operational in FY 2024-25 for AY 2025-26. (3) Continuing confirmation of thresholds and criteria: Numerous 2024–2025 guidance articles (ClearTax section 44AB; Bajaj Finserv; Tax2Win; TheLegalSchool; EFileTax; Suvit; TaxGuru’s AY 2024-25 criteria article) reaffirm the key thresholds and rules for tax audit applicability—namely, ₹1 crore turnover limit for business, enhanced ₹10 crore limit where cash receipts/payments are ≤5% of total, ₹50 lakh gross receipts limit for professions, and interaction with presumptive taxation (section 44AD) where turnover up to ₹2 crore with presumptive profit at prescribed rates avoids audit. EFileTax’s June 2025 article summarises for FY 2024-25 that tax audit applies if turnover exceeds ₹1 crore or if digital payments are below 95%, aligning with the statutory 5% cash threshold for the enhanced limit. (4) Non-audit ITR deadline change for FY 2024-25: The PIB press note dated 7 September 2025 states that the '15 September 2025 deadline (extended from the usual 31 July) is for non-audit cases', covering individuals filing ITR-1 to ITR-4. This is not a tax-audit requirement but is important context, indicating that for FY 2024-25 non-audit taxpayers got additional time until 15 September 2025 to file ITRs, while audit cases had their own extended timelines (ultimately 10 November 2025 for audit reports and 10 December 2025 for ITRs as per TaxGuru). (5) New penalty for liaison offices from 1 April 2025: The Income Tax Department’s 'Penalties' chart includes a new entry: 'Failure to submit statement under section 285 by a non-resident having liaison office in India (applicable with effect from April 1, 2025), Rs. 1,000 per day ...'. While this pertains to section 285 (not section 44AB) and specifically to non-resident liaison offices, it is a 2025 compliance change that can affect foreign SMEs with liaison offices in India, introducing a per-day penalty of ₹1,000 for non-filing of that statement, separate from tax audit penalties. (6) Penalty regime stability and future codification: Articles such as eBizFiling’s 'Tax Audit for Private Limited Companies 2025', PKC India’s analysis of penalties, and Taxtmi’s comparison of Clause 446 of the Income Tax Bill, 2025 with section 271B all reflect that the core tax audit penalty regime—0.5% of turnover/gross receipts capped at ₹150,000—remains unchanged for AY 2025-26, and that the proposed Income Tax Bill, 2025 contemplates a similar structure (Clause 446), preserving the cap at ₹150,000 even for large businesses. (7) Heightened emphasis on compliance for companies and statutory audits: PKC India’s blog and eBizFiling’s 2025 article underline that private limited companies and other corporates must comply not just with tax audit obligations but also with statutory audit requirements under the Companies Act. Non-compliance can therefore result in layered penalties—tax audit penalty under section 271B plus Companies Act penalties ranging from around ₹25,000 to ₹500,000 for statutory audit failures.",
        "stateSpecificNotes": "The income tax audit regime under section 44AB is a central law requirement administered by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). The search results do not indicate any state-specific variations in thresholds, forms or deadlines. SMEs operating in any Indian state or union territory are subject to the same section 44AB rules, though they may have additional state-level compliances (like VAT legacy issues, professional tax, or state GST administration) that are separate from the central tax audit requirement.",
        "interactionWithITRDeadlines": "Tax audit timing is tightly linked to ITR filing deadlines. For FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): (1) Non-audit cases: As per the PIB press note dated 7 September 2025, the usual 31 July deadline for non-audit ITRs was extended to 15 September 2025 for individuals and small taxpayers filing ITR-1 to ITR-4. (2) Audit cases (non-transfer pricing): TaxGuru’s 31 October 2025 article states that along with extending the tax audit report due date to 10 November 2025, CBDT extended the ITR due date for non-transfer pricing (non-TP) audit cases to 10 December 2025. (3) Transfer pricing (TP) cases: The same TaxGuru article notes that TP cases (which must obtain a separate transfer pricing accountant’s report, typically not covered by section 44AB) are required to file their ITR by 30 November (presumably 30 November 2025). These staggered deadlines mean SMEs subject to tax audit but not TP must finalise their audit by 10 November 2025 and file their ITR by 10 December 2025, while non-audit SMEs had a 15 September 2025 ITR deadline, and TP cases faced a 30 November 2025 deadline.",
        "otherRelatedPenalties": "Beyond section 271B tax audit penalties and the new section 285 penalty noted in the Income Tax Department’s penalty chart, PKC India’s 2025 article highlights that non-compliance with broader statutory audit obligations carries its own sanctions. For example, under the Companies Act, penalties for failures related to statutory audit can range approximately from ₹25,000 to ₹500,000 depending on contravention and adjudicating officer’s order. PKC India also notes that there can be additional consequences such as disqualification of directors or auditors and reputational harm. These penalties are separate from, and in addition to, tax audit penalties under section 271B. As such, SMEs that are incorporated entities must treat both company law audit and tax audit as critical parts of their compliance framework.",
        "practicalImplicationsForSMEs": "Taken together, the 2025 search results indicate that for SMEs: (1) Monitoring turnover and receipts mix is critical: SMEs nearing the ₹1 crore or ₹10 crore thresholds must track both turnover and the share of cash vs digital transactions. Staying within 95% digital receipts/payments can significantly reduce audit obligations up to ₹10 crore turnover. (2) Leveraging presumptive schemes carefully: For eligible small businesses under section 44AD with turnover up to ₹2 crore, opting for presumptive taxation and declaring prescribed presumptive income (6%/8%) can avoid tax audit, but choosing to declare lower profits may trigger mandatory audit. (3) Planning for changing due dates: For FY 2024-25, CBDT’s multiple extensions illustrate that due dates can change fairly close to deadlines. SMEs should follow official portals (News & e-Campaigns, CBDT circulars) and reliable guidance sites (TaxGuru, ClearTax) to ensure they work with current deadlines. (4) Adapting to form changes: The 'top five changes' in Form 3CD for AY 2025-26 and the enabling of updated audit utilities (35/36 clauses) mean SMEs and CAs must review new reporting requirements and prepare data accordingly; old templates may lead to errors or rejections. (5) Overseas and liaison office operations: Foreign SMEs with liaison offices in India face a new daily penalty of ₹1,000 from 1 April 2025 for failure to submit the statement under section 285, on top of ordinary audit obligations that may arise under section 44AB depending on activities. (6) Integrated risk management: Because statutory audit (Companies Act) penalties and tax audit penalties can both apply, and because missed audits can also delay ITR filings and trigger late fees and interest, SMEs should integrate audit compliance into overall financial closing and governance processes rather than treat it as a standalone exercise."

The Bihar Shops and Establishments Employment Regulation and Conditions of Service Act, 2025 (as summarized by greytHR) introduces 'graded punishment for repeated violations', meaning fines escalate on repeat offences. EY’s 2025 alert on Haryana reports that imprisonment provisions for minor violations under the Haryana Shops and Commercial Establishments Act have been removed and replaced with monetary penalties, indicating a trend toward monetary (rather than custodial) penalties for registration-related lapses.

ALP Consulting’s checklist identifies 'Fines for non‑maintenance of registers' as a separate category of penalties. Corpzo (2024) further notes that non‑compliance identified during inspections—which can include missing or incomplete registers—can result in fines ranging from ₹1,000 to ₹10,000, with legal action possible in severe or repeated cases. For Punjab, the 2025 amendment (Legality Simplified; Lawrbit) provides that even such register‑related offences are subject to the updated slabs (₹500–₹2,000 for the first offence and a higher range starting at ₹3,000 for subsequent offences), with scope for compounding. Exact minimum and maximum fines for non‑maintenance of the Register of Fines, and any per‑day fine for continuing default, are prescribed by each state’s Act and rules, and are not fully detailed in the provided snippets."

The IndiaFilings article notes that the penalty for not maintaining required registers can range from 'hundred to a thousand' rupees, indicating a typical lower band for first‑level register offences. ALP Consulting (2025) explicitly notes fines for non‑maintenance of registers. If, during an inspection, the absence or incompleteness of the Register of Deductions is found, Corpzo’s general range of ₹1,000–₹10,000 for non‑compliance may apply, depending on state law and the inspector’s findings. Punjab’s 2025 amendment provides more specific slabs (₹500–₹2,000 for first offences and starting at ₹3,000 for subsequent offences, with compounding possibilities), while Bihar’s 2025 Act introduces graded penalties that increase for repeated non‑compliance. Exact per‑day penalties and interest (if any) for continuing failure to maintain this register are not stated in the search results and must be obtained from the applicable state statute."

      "additionalInfo": {
        "registration": "Core registration requirements under the Shops and Establishments framework, as described across the search results, are as follows:\n\n1) Coverage: India Briefing (2024) notes that all shops and commercial establishments covered under the respective state Shops and Establishments Acts must register with the relevant authority and obtain a registration certificate. India Advocacy (2025) reiterates that any new shop or commercial establishment must register within the prescribed period (30 days of commencement) under the applicable state Act.\n\n2) Time limit: Prompt Personnel’s 'Ultimate Guide to Statutory Compliance in India 2025' explicitly states 'Registration required within 30 days of starting business operations' for shops and commercial establishments. The Karnataka eKarmika portal specifies that each owner, within 30 days from starting the business, shall submit an application in Form 'A' to register the establishment. This 30‑day limit is widely referred to across guidance sources as the standard timeframe, though exact wording can differ by state.\n\n3) Process and documents: While detailed document lists are not fully spelt out in the snippets, the Assam Labour Commissionerate’s 'Registration / Auto Renewal of Shops & Establishments' page notes that any applicant should have the trade license issued by the relevant authority and other documents for registration under the Assam Shops and Establishments framework. This implies that, at least in Assam, a trade license (from the municipal or local body) is a prerequisite for registration. In general, state portals (such as Karnataka’s eKarmika and West Bengal’s wbshopsonline.gov.in) require standard establishment information, identity/address proofs of the owner, business address proof, and details of employees; the precise list is state‑specific.\n\n4) Mode of application: Several states have moved to online registration. Examples from the results include: (a) Assam, which offers online registration and auto‑renewal through the Labour Commissionerate portal; (b) Karnataka, which provides registration services through the eKarmika portal; (c) West Bengal, which has an online portal (wbshopsonline.gov.in) offering registration and related services; and (d) Goa, whose 2025 Act explicitly requires renewal applications to be submitted online and is likely to support online registration as well. Maharashtra’s 2025 blog reference indicates online renewal via the Maharashtra Labour Department portal, implying similar online facilities for registration.\n\n5) Registration certificate: Once registration is approved, a registration certificate is issued. While not detailed in the snippets, such certificates generally specify the name and address of the establishment, employer details, and permitted number of employees and must be displayed at the premises. India Advocacy (2025), though truncated in the snippet, indicates that once issued, the registration certificate must be retained and, typically, displayed.\n\n6) One-time vs repeat registration: Registration is normally a one‑time event per establishment, but the validity of the certificate (and consequent need for renewal) is state‑specific. Some states issue certificates for fixed periods requiring periodic renewal; others have moved toward longer or even perpetual validity (e.g., Delhi’s move to do away with mandatory 21‑year renewal; possible auto‑renew regimes).",
        "renewal": "Renewal requirements and frequency under Shops and Establishments Acts vary across states and are reflected in several of the search results:\n\n1) General rule: ClearTax (Aug 2025) notes that the Shop and Establishment registration application 'needs to be renewed before the expiry of the period of registration'. This is a general requirement in states that issue time‑bound certificates (e.g., 1–5 years or 21 years, depending on historical practice).\n\n2) Maharashtra: The Agile Regulatory 2025 article specifies that renewal can be done online through the Maharashtra Labour Department’s portal. While the snippet does not specify the renewal cycle or timing, it confirms that Maharashtra uses an online process for renewals.\n\n3) Delhi: The same Agile Regulatory article states that in Delhi, businesses must apply for renewal at least 30 days (the snippet is truncated but implies 'before expiry'). Separately, the Economic Times article (Nov 2025) reports that the Delhi government has abolished the provision of mandatory renewal of registration every 21 years under the Delhi Shops and Establishments Act, 1954. Thus, earlier long‑cycle renewal requirements have been removed, and registrations may now effectively be of indefinite duration (subject to confirmation from the amendments and notifications, including the 07/08/2025 notification on Sections 14, 15, 16).\n\n4) Goa: The Goa Shops and Establishments Act, 2025 (Act 23 of 2025) provides that an application for the renewal of a registration certificate shall be submitted online not less than thirty days before the date of expiry of the certificate. This codifies a 30‑day advance renewal requirement and an online mode of submission.\n\n5) Puducherry: The Puducherry Shops and Establishments Act, 1964 information page notes that renewal of a registration certificate must be done before the date of expiry and that renewal fees are the same as those specified for registration. No explicit 30‑day lead time is stated in the snippet.\n\n6) Assam: The 'Registration / Auto Renewal of Shops & Establishments' page for Assam indicates that auto‑renewal is available, implying that once certain preconditions are met (such as valid trade license and continuous operation), the registration may be renewed automatically, likely through the online system. The exact cycle (annual or multi‑year) and detailed conditions are not given in the snippet.\n\n7) Frequency: The frequency of renewal (annual, multi‑year, or very long‑term such as 21 years historically in Delhi) is not standardized among states and is not comprehensively detailed in the search results. SMEs must confirm the validity period printed on their registration certificate or as per the relevant state rules and schedule renewal accordingly.\n\n8) Fees: Puducherry explicitly states that renewal fees are the same as registration fees. Other states follow their own fee schedules; these are not specified in the snippets and must be checked on state portals or in fee notifications.",
        "filingMethod": "Filing methods for Shops and Establishments compliances are increasingly online, but offline options may still exist in some jurisdictions:\n\n1) Online registration and renewal: Assam (labourcommissioner.assam.gov.in) offers online registration and auto‑renewal for shops and establishments, with trade license and other documents required for registration. Maharashtra’s Labour Department provides an online portal for license renewal, as cited by Agile Regulatory (2025). Karnataka’s eKarmika portal and West Bengal’s wbshopsonline.gov.in portal enable employers to apply online for registration, incorporate changes, apply for winding up, and upload relevant documents. Goa’s 2025 Act explicitly refers to renewal applications being submitted online, signalling a digital filing framework.\n\n2) Online changes and closure: West Bengal’s portal specifically mentions modules for 'incorporation of changes' and 'application for winding up', which are handled entirely online. Similar systems likely exist or are being implemented in other states.\n\n3) Offline or hybrid: Some older Acts and smaller jurisdictions may still permit or require physical (paper) applications submitted at the labour department or local inspector’s office, although the search results predominantly feature online systems. In practice, SMEs should check whether their state has fully migrated to online processes or whether any documents or original certificates must still be physically submitted or collected.\n\n4) Returns and registers: Annual returns, where required, may be filed online (through state portals) or offline, depending on the state’s digitization status. Statutory registers (such as the Register of Fines and Register of Deductions) are generally maintained at the establishment premises in prescribed formats and produced during inspections; they are not routinely uploaded or filed unless specifically required by a given state’s e‑governance interface.",
        "prerequisites": "Key prerequisites and dependencies for Shops and Establishments compliance, inferred from the search results and general regulatory practice, include:\n\n1) Trade license and local approvals: Assam’s Labour Commissionerate page explicitly states that any entrepreneur/applicant should have the trade license issued by the relevant authority and other documents for registration under the Assam Shops and Establishments framework. This indicates that, at least in Assam, obtaining a municipal/local trade license is a precondition or parallel requirement for Shops and Establishments registration. Many other states similarly expect that basic municipal permissions and registrations (such as trade license, building/occupancy permissions, and local business registrations) are in place.\n\n2) Basic business and identity documentation: While not enumerated in the snippets, standard practice for such registrations includes proof of business constitution (partnership deed, incorporation certificate, etc.), proof of principal place of business (rent agreement, title document, utility bills), identity and address proofs of the employer/manager, photographs, and PAN and/or other tax registration numbers. The exact document list is provided in each state’s portal or rules.\n\n3) Employee details: Registration and ongoing compliance (including annual returns) generally require details of employees (numbers by gender, category, and type of work), which must be maintained accurately in the statutory registers and may need to be furnished at registration or in subsequent returns, as indicated by ALP’s checklist (which references employee hours, wage compliance, and records).\n\n4) Linkages with other labour laws: Although not deeply discussed in the snippets, compliance under Shops and Establishments Acts interacts with other labour laws referenced in Prompt Personnel’s 2025 statutory guide (such as contract labour laws, social security laws, etc.). An establishment that registers under Shops and Establishments also typically must evaluate its obligations under EPF, ESIC, professional tax, minimum wage notifications, and other labour‑related laws, but those contribution‑based statutes are separate and not part of the Shops and Establishments compliance per se.\n\n5) State‑specific forms and formats: Karnataka’s use of Form 'A' for registration, and the explicit mention of specific registers (Register of Fines, Register of Deductions) by SGCMS, underline that each state prescribes its own set of forms and register formats that must be used (often identified by form letters/numbers in the rules).",
        "recentUpdates": "Key 2025 updates and changes related to Shops and Establishments compliance surfaced in the search results include:\n\n1) Goa – New Act (2025): The Goa Shops and Establishments Act, 2025 (Act 23 of 2025) and the related Bill (Bill No. 36 of 2025) modernise the regulation of shops and establishments in Goa. The Act, as noted in the snippet, requires that an application for renewal of a registration certificate be submitted online not less than thirty days before the expiry date, indicating a shift to an online regime and clear advance renewal timelines. The Bill’s full text (available on the Goa Vidhan Sabha site) covers regulation of employment and conditions of service.\n\n2) Delhi – Removal of 21‑year renewal requirement (2025): A November 2025 Economic Times article reports that the Delhi government has abolished the provision of mandatory renewal of registration every 21 years under the Delhi Shops and Establishments Act, 1954. This reform reduces the long‑cycle administrative burden for establishments in Delhi. Additionally, the Labour Department notification of 07/08/2025 relating to Sections 14, 15, and 16 of the Act (available on labour.delhi.gov.in) indicates targeted amendments or clarifications concerning those sections (which in the 1954 Act relate to certain employment conditions, such as opening and closing hours and weekly holidays), though details are not given in the snippet and must be read in the underlying notification.\n\n3) Telangana – Exemption for establishments with up to 10 employees (2025): The Karma Management blog summarises a government decision that 'exempts all Shops & Establishments employing upto 10 employees from the applicability of the Shops Act' in Telangana. This is a significant threshold change, essentially removing micro establishments (with 10 or fewer employees) from the ambit of the Telangana Shops and Establishments Act, thereby reducing registration and ongoing compliance obligations for such small entities. Larger establishments remain covered.\n\n4) Punjab – 2025 Amendments (New penalties and compounding): Lawrbit and Legality Simplified articles describe 2025 amendments to the Punjab Shops and Commercial Establishments Act. These amendments introduce new penalty slabs and compounding provisions: (a) first offence fines between ₹500 and ₹2,000; (b) subsequent offence fines starting from ₹3,000 (the upper limit is truncated in the snippet and needs confirmation from the amendment text); and (c) the possibility of compounding certain offences, allowing settlement of violations on payment of prescribed amounts instead of prosecution. The Lawrbit article advises establishments to review compliance processes in light of the new penalties and compounding possibilities.\n\n5) Haryana – 2025 Amendments (Rationalised penalties): EY’s 2025 alert on amendments to the Haryana Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1958 notes that imprisonment provisions for minor violations have been removed and replaced with monetary penalties, which have been 'substantially' rationalised (specific monetary amounts are not provided in the snippet). This marks a shift toward a more monetary‑penalty‑oriented enforcement approach while potentially reducing custodial exposure for technical breaches.\n\n6) Bihar – New Shops and Establishments Act, 2025: PRS India provides the text of the Bihar Shops and Establishments Act, 2025 (Act 9 of 2025). The greytHR notification summary notes that the Act prescribes penalties for non‑compliance with graded punishment for repeated violations and that it modernises labour regulation for shops and establishments in the state. The snippet includes a fragment on protections (e.g., 'Protection of persons acting under this Act – No suit, prosecution or other...'), implying enhanced protections for officials alongside updated compliance duties for employers.\n\n7) Updated 2025 guidance/checklists: Several guidance resources updated in 2025 reflect and integrate the above statutory changes and provide practical compliance checklists. These include: (a) Prompt Personnel’s 'Ultimate Guide to Statutory Compliance in India 2025', emphasising that shops and commercial establishments must register within 30 days of starting operations and summarising key statutory obligations; (b) ALP Consulting’s 'Shop and Establishment Act Compliance Checklist 2025', which outlines core compliance areas (licensing, employee hours, wage compliance, safety, workplace policies, record‑keeping, and penalties for non‑compliance, including fines for late registration and non‑maintenance of registers); (c) India Advocacy’s July 2025 explainer on Shops and Establishments Acts; and (d) ComplifyXpert’s September 2025 state‑wise guide, which consolidates procedures and checklists under the Act.\n\n8) Penalty clarifications (2024–2025): IndiaFilings’ August 2025 article and Corpzo’s October 2024 article on penalties under the Shops and Establishments Act provide updated penalty guidance: (a) IndiaFilings indicates penalties for not maintaining required registers in the range of a hundred to a thousand rupees, with additional fines for working‑hour and other violations; (b) Corpzo states that businesses may face fines from ₹1,000 to ₹10,000 for non‑compliance discovered during inspections, with potential legal action in severe cases.
